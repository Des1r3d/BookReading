Chapter 268: The Proxy

Back in the tomb on the Icefang Island, there was no body of the Fire God 【Faer】 inside the ice coffin.

Based on some leftover signs at the scene, Violet first thought that someone had entered the temple before them and stolen the god’s remains, which was why the coffin was almost empty.

But this was not the truth.

Violet now clearly knew that the one who entered the temple first was Miss Le Qiaoqiao, a Vampire Ancestor and a professional thief.

Even so, in the end she only followed Hen’s instructions and placed the “Book of Truth”. The inner-world key that could lead to the Lower Dimension and the burial place of the 【Blazing Phoenix God】 there. She did not take anything else or do anything unnecessary.

Violet had already received a clear answer about this from the Vampire Ancestor herself, and judging from all the known information, the chance that Le Qiaoqiao was lying was very low.

From the very beginning, there were no divine remains inside the Fire God’s Tomb. The reason the Snow God, Sinong, built it was likely closer to a memorial tomb, a symbolic grave, meant to honor 【Faer】’s existence, using the flame spear 【World Burner】, the weapon 【Faer】 once used.

So then, where did the real remains of the Fire God 【Faer】 go after his fall?

What now appeared before Violet and the others, might be the answer.

The priestess fell into deep thought.

If this broken finger truly came from 【Faer】’s divine body, then judging by the Snow God’s power sealed within the ice crystal, there were likely far more fragments like this than just the one they were seeing now.

The Fire God not only fell, Their divine body was even broken apart, like it was cut into many pieces. Each fragment was wrapped in scattered portions of the Snow God’s original power and sealed deep underground, buried in endless darkness…

Two gods, once supreme rulers standing at the very top of this world, had sacrificed themselves in such a tragic way, breaking into countless fragments and sleeping together in darkness unknown to anyone for hundreds or even thousands of years.

What kind of goal could be so important that they were willing to pay such a price?

Just then, the Dragon God, who was also curiously looking at the broken finger, but clearly not thinking as deeply as the priestess, focusing more on the object itself, seemed to notice something and cried out in surprise.

“Master, look! This thing… doesn’t its color look a little different now?”

“Hm?”

Following her reminder, Violet raised her head and looked again at the finger inside the ice crystal.

Sure enough, just as she said, at some unknown moment, the originally bright red flames had begun to change, very slightly, but clearly.

A faint trace of black flame quietly appeared from the deepest part of the fire, like ink dropped into clear water. Little by little, slowly but visibly, it spread outward, dyeing the red flames around it.

This is…?

The priestess raised her eyebrows slightly in surprise.

As someone who also controlled power at the level of natural laws, she could clearly see the true nature of what was happening.

This ice crystal, formed from the pure divine power of the Snow God, sealed the broken finger. But at the same time, it also protected it in another way. It blocked almost all outside forces and interference.

In theory, this meant that the finger should not change at all unless the outer ice crystal itself was destroyed.

Unless…

The change was coming from its own source, from the inside out.

“So it’s Flame Calamity again…”

The girl let out a soft sigh and shook her head helplessly.

That deep, dark black flame. Violet recognized its true nature at a glance.

This little thing was like an unkillable cockroach. Every time it showed up, she would smash it hard and beat it down without mercy. Yet it still managed to survive, and after some time, it would return again, stronger than before.

To be honest, by now the priestess could finally understand why Aiksmont insisted on secretly asking her to deal with this thing. If it were anyone else trying to capture it, they would probably be killed in just one or two attempts. In the end, it might even turn into a chain disaster, like people rushing in one after another only to die, one rescue after another, all failing.

But even for Violet, this thing called “Yan” was truly troublesome.

It was not that she had no way to deal with it. The real problem was that Hen, or rather the Star Court, had made it very clear that they intended to protect this thing. And Yan always hid herself carefully, never showing her real body or location. Unless Violet was willing to ignore everything and flip the entire board at any cost, she really could not act freely for now.

In the end, the most important reason was simple. Violet did not want to openly turn against Hen.

Even though Hen’s actions now seemed very dangerous, Violet still kept a subtle sense of trust toward her, her closest and most important friend for so many years.

Maybe things were far more complicated than they looked. Maybe Hen truly had reasons she could not explain. Even after meeting her in the dream world and hearing her answers, deep in Violet’s heart, that hope still remained.

That was why she chose to look the other way.

On the surface, she showed no mercy toward Flame Calamity, but she never truly delivered a final, fatal blow.

Hen would never do something without reason. She was protecting Yan at all costs, even throwing Le Qiaoqiao out as a shield and giving up such a useful helper. That could only mean one thing, she needed Yan to achieve some deeper goal.

Violet was gambling.

She was betting that the final goal of the Star Court would be beneficial to her and to the things she cared about, or at least that the benefits would outweigh the harm.

So far, she still could not fully see through the thick fog covering the true core of this grand game.

But…

She was very close now.

“Master, why did this thing appear here…?”

The Dragon God naturally also knew about Flame Calamity. After all, it was something that had come from her own power, a kind of twisted “copy.” But Xiao Guang clearly was not thinking about all those complicated matters. Faced with her simple question, Violet only shook her head lightly.

“We still need one key breakthrough. Something that can truly touch the core of this huge plan, and act as the final signal to open the path forward.”

“That sounds really troublesome… We’re already this far. Can’t we just finish it directly?”

Seeing her dragon companion looking confused yet eager to try, the priestess smiled and gently rubbed her head, then shook her head again.

“Silly girl. Even if a dragon has the power to destroy an entire castle in one moment, how would you press a tiny hidden switch deep inside it? Ordinary people have things only they can do. Learning to use the strength of others is also a required lesson for true strength.”

“…Mm!”

“Eeh~!”

“What does this have to do with you!? Shut up, stupid puppet!”

………………………

“BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!!!”

Somewhere in the eternally frozen world of extreme cold, a tense and thrilling escape was playing out at full speed.

“WAAAAAH!!! What the hell is this thing anyway!? Why does it keep chasing us!?!”

The brown-haired girl with a ponytail was leading the way, crouching low as she slid at high speed across the frozen ice, moving in a way that looked just a little ridiculous.

A certain vampire girl and a mysterious cloaked woman followed close behind in the same way. Farther back in the air, several deep-black flames shaped like living snakes flew forward with loud roars. They were only about ten meters behind the three women, as if any brief pause would let them crash into their backs and burn them to ashes.

Oh, by the way, at the beginning they were actually running. But later they realized the ice was far too slippery. Running made it easy to fall, and their speed was nowhere near enough to escape the black flames flying behind them. So Miss Sasha was the first to use her clever little brain and come up with this method. When the other two saw that it worked, they copied her without hesitation.

“Woohoo! This is so exciting! I didn’t know you could use snowy ground like this!!!”

Miss Valentia shouted happily while waving her arms again and again. It was hard to tell whether she was trying to keep her balance or was simply too excited by this new experience. She had completely lost the tense look she had at the start of the escape, which made Sasha feel speechless.

“Hey! Be serious! Show some respect to that unknown thing chasing us, okay?! And also, why are you sticking to us and running along like this?!”

Even while being complained about by the merchant girl, the mysterious cloaked woman remained calm. Aside from her rather funny posture, clearly the result of learning from an unreliable teacher, she looked surprisingly steady under pressure and replied,

“Then what? Stay behind and fight until death to buy you time? Do I look like a selfless saint who sacrifices herself for others?”

“Damn it! Why does that actually sound reasonable?!”

Sasha cursed in frustration, then suddenly realized something.

“Wait, no! Valentia, didn’t you say that in this place everything is restricted, and we can’t use those weird powers? Then how is that thing behind us able to do this?!”

“Haha! I don’t know~!”

The vampire girl’s overly excited, carefree reply earned her two strong eye-rolls. At this critical moment, the mysterious woman, who not long ago had been intent on killing them to achieve some unknown goal, turned out to be the most reliable one. She spoke in a low, serious voice.

“The 【Forbidden Domain】 is a divine realm left behind by the Snow God. The rules here do suppress any outsider not recognized by this place. But that rule is not absolute. There are still two situations where power can be used.”

Despite her secretive appearance, the woman did not seem to enjoy speaking in riddles. Before Sasha could ask, she continued on her own.

“First, the user is granted permission by the rules of this place, or more simply, the power is born from the laws of the 【Forbidden Domain】 itself. This kind of force is usually called a Trial. It can never be beaten by brute force. You can only follow the rules and use your mind to find the solution prepared in advance.”

“Why do you sound so experienced?! So that thing is a trial?!”

“…No.”

The mysterious woman shook her head. Beneath her hood, faint ice-blue eyes flickered with something like memory and longing, as she spoke honestly.

“The trials left by the Snow God can only use power of the same origin. Their form and presence are very easy to recognize. But this flame… clearly does not belong to Their authority. So it is far more likely to be the second case.”

“It is an intruder, an existence that invaded the source of the 【Forbidden Domain】 through a chain of cause and effect that only gods can interfere with. I’m sure of it. It… no, They are devouring and absorbing the 【Forbidden】. This power has already gone beyond the limits of the laws themselves. That one didn’t lie to me… We must find a way to stop Them!”

“Hey, hey! Is now really the time to talk about that?! Let’s focus on staying alive first!!!”
