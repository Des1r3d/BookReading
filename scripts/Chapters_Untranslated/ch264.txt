Chapter 264: Burning Ice

Looking at the scene before her, something almost beyond understanding, beyond all guesses and possibilities, like a dream and yet like an epic myth, Kellian felt her thoughts nearly come to a stop.

Was it because she had lost too much blood?

Or was this simply a vision born at the moment of death?

Maybe. But the High Priestess believed that even if she were in perfect condition, her reaction would not be much better than it was now.

Even so, this was only the beginning.

“Whoosh—!!!”

Along with a humming sound like a divine melody, brilliant and dazzling pure white wings of light suddenly spread wide behind the girl!

The wings beat lightly, scattering countless sparks of beautiful light like stardust. Those lights then gathered together in a natural, indescribable way, forming a holy figure almost exactly the same as the girl herself, but made entirely of pure light.

Even though they were inside a tunnel no more than a few dozen meters wide, the narrow space seemed completely unable to limit that grand and beautiful form, which spread out freely as if it were endless.

The being held a supreme golden holy spear made of light. As the shining wings behind the girl gently moved, the spear passed beyond the line where the girl stood alone, blocking the terrifying 【Frostflow】 with one hand, and pointed straight ahead.

What… was she going to do?

As the only witness to this dreamlike scene, Kellian could not help but feel doubt—and even more, a rising sense of hope.

She could not understand this power, or the level and meaning of the girl who wielded it. She could not even measure its strength in any clear way. Yet she understood one thing: if this strange and unreal scene was not just a dying illusion, then the future of Ice Lotus Fortress, and the lives of countless beings here, might now depend on this battle that went far beyond human reason and imagination.

Even if her own death was already unavoidable, as a High Priest who had silently protected this land for nearly a hundred years, Kellian truly hoped that the girl before her could stop this out-of-control “Wrath of a God” and bring a real miracle and salvation.

Very soon, she received the answer before her eyes.

That answer was a way to suppress the rampaging power of a true god, a method that no mortal could even imagine.

“Xiao Guang.”

“Yes!”

One call, one reply.

There was no extra talk, no loud or heroic speech. With just those simple words, and without even exchanging a glance, the two girls seemed to fully understand each other.

The young woman who had been standing quietly beside the black-haired girl all this time, taller in figure and with long hair like blazing red-gold flames, raised her hand. She made no obvious movement, yet at the tips of her long, pale fingers, golden fire suddenly appeared.

At that moment, the world fell strangely silent.

Though it was only a small flame, trembling like a candle, the instant it was lit, it felt as if truth itself had taken form, naturally becoming the absolute center of everything around it.

Even the raging 【Frostflow】 of extreme cold, which had been crashing against the golden wall of light with ever-growing thunderous noise, silently turned into nothing more than a background for that flame. The harsh, deafening sounds seemed to be muted and erased by some unseen force, leaving only the gently burning red-gold fire…

No, this was not quite right.

When the small flame was reflected in her eyes, and then sudden, sharp pain burned through them, Kellian could not help but close her eyes. Even so, tears still flowed down her cheeks. And at that moment, she suddenly understood.

The noise had not disappeared for no reason.

It had been… burned away.

The moment those sounds were born, they were completely burned up by that seemingly weak golden flame, so they never reached her ears.

It was not just sound. All the magic, elements, and even concepts in this space were quietly turned into ashes by that firelight. Because the flame burned everything away, making all other concepts lose their meaning, it became the absolute center of this world.

And the reason Kellian could remain within this firelit area, even directly look at that existence with her own eyes without being truly harmed, was not because Kellian Sinong was special or strong. It was simply because the owner of the golden flame, the girl, had shown mercy and carefully limited its effect on her.

By the Snow God above! To control such terrifying power so freely… what kind of—

Before the storm of thoughts in the High Priestess’s mind could calm down, the two girls, whose actions clearly showed they were working together, in ways far beyond her understanding, had already moved to the next step.

The blonde girl lightly waved her hand. The flame burning at her fingertips naturally separated and gently floated away, drifting toward the tip of the holy spear where lightning-like light was surging.

No, more precisely, it flew to the air just in front of the spear.

At the same time, the holy being made of light moved in perfect timing, throwing the fully charged long spear forward!

“Bang!!!!!”

Almost the instant the spear left her hand, it turned into a blazing golden streak. It caused a loud sonic boom as it flew through the air, and where it passed, it even tore open long, dark cracks in space itself, striking the golden flame at the exact moment it reached its highest point!

“Boom!!!”

The holy spear of light collided directly with the golden flame, yet there was no explosion or violent clash. Instead, the flame suddenly spread out and expanded, smoothly wrapping itself around the golden spear, fusing with it like an enchantment and covering it in burning golden fire!

And so, the “fire spear,” now ignited by golden flames, passed through the light barrier raised by the black-haired girl and plunged into the raging 【Frostflow】!

In that instant, the storm of frost fell into a brief, unnatural silence.

Then, it exploded!

“BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!!!!”

Unbelievable! Wherever the holy spear mixed with golden flames passed, the surging 【Frostflow】 that represented 【Extreme Cold】 was instantly ignited, turning into even more violent, towering flames that rolled back toward the direction it had come from!

Kellian felt her heart tremble violently.

She clearly remembered that just moments ago, it was that absolute 【Extreme Cold】, which could freeze everything, that had crushed and eaten away their combined defense at the level of concepts, wiping out the elite of the Temple almost instantly, with nearly no chance to resist.

That was an almost absolute rule, a 【Law】 and 【Authority】 that only the highest gods could possess, the unshakable peak of this world.

And yet now, this power that should stand above all else, freezing every element, all magic, space, and even time itself…

Was burning.

Yes. It was burning.

Without a doubt, the flames overwhelmed the oncoming 【Frostflow】. Between the 【Extreme Cold】 that could freeze everything and the 【Golden Flame】 that burned all things, the latter showed a greater, more absolute dominance.

This should have been something impossible. More unreal than any dream or imagination, something so absurd it was almost a betrayal of faith.

And yet…

It had become reality.
