Chapter 261: The Frozen Gate

But no matter how much it was sealed and suppressed, even if it was weakened to the point that a small, insignificant soul like Valentia’s could barely control it, a god was still a god.

Even now, when she could hardly use even one ten-thousandth of the power a god should have at full strength, compared to ordinary mortals or even her former self, she was still overwhelmingly stronger, on a completely different level.

The girl had proven this through more than one experiment. Although she had never thought of using this power for personal gain, nor of bullying others with strength and feeling proud of it, the power still existed. It would not change or waver because of what Valentia thought in her heart.

Just like now, without this body that was godlike in essence, she probably could not have directly interfered with and rewritten the creation before her, which was also likely left behind by a god.

Even if her theoretical knowledge could barely touch that level, a mortal body simply could not endure the backlash of such actions. Even vampire race bodies were no exception.

Between Mythical Beings and Gods, it might seem like only one rank apart, but the real gap, the vast and unbridgeable divide, was even greater than the difference between mythical beings and mortals.

Because of this, Valentia was certain that what she was doing now was absolutely not part of the original planner’s design.

Catching the enemy off guard.

Breaking the rules.

This was her counterattack.

“Clatter clatter clatter clatter clatter clatter…”

The dense sound of footsteps drawing closer was like rapid drumbeats pounding on the girl’s heart. Valentia stayed fully focused on breaking the formation in front of her. Outside, the assassins who had been forced to take a longer route, or rather their true commander seemed to sense something and suddenly began to speed up.

The vampire girl’s mental senses spread outward. Although they were far from the vast awareness of a true god, when combined with the vampire race’s natural ability to sense blood energy, they were enough at this distance to roughly judge the enemy’s movements and positions.

She said nothing and did not pass this information on to the others to avoid causing unnecessary panic. Because even if they knew the truth, what the survivors hiding here needed to do, and could do, would not change at all.

In the enemy’s plan, at this moment, they were already no different from fish on a chopping board.

As her weak divine awareness continued to spread, Valentia could even faintly feel a killing intent that was growing closer, icy cold and bone-chilling.

There was no doubt about it. This was a truly terrifying enemy, far stronger than the ordinary assassins she had faced before.

The girl was almost certain that this was the core and elite force of the invaders who attacked Ice Lotus Castle. Once they arrived and joined the fight, the already desperate survivors would collapse very quickly.

Because her divine awareness was too weak, Valentia could not judge exactly how powerful the source of that freezing aura was, nor whether she had any chance to fight it. But the vampire girl had no intention of gambling on such a possibility.

If she had obtained this godly body earlier, she might have become overconfident and tried to solve everything with force. But after meeting that priestess, and the Vampire Ancestor, and seeing the true power of the strongest beings in this world, Valentia now placed herself very low.

No matter when or where, never underestimate any enemy.

“Hey, hey… I think I hear a lot of footsteps. Don’t tell me it’s really…”

As an archer with especially sharp hearing, Miss Sasha was the second to notice something was wrong. She turned back and looked at the vampire race girl who was fully absorbed in the formation in front of her, not even reacting to what was just said. Sasha’s face showed hesitation and struggle.

“Ah… whatever! If I die, I die!”

In the end, the brown-haired girl could only grit her teeth, lift her weapon, and prepare to step toward the door.

Since she had chosen to believe, she would trust completely and give everything!

She would buy time for Valentia, do her absolute best to guard this one and only possible light of hope!

But just as Miss Sasha took her first step, ready to rush into battle without hesitation, an excited shout suddenly rang out from behind her!

“It worked!”

“Huh…?”

Sasha froze for a moment. But before she even had time to turn around and see what the vampire girl meant by “worked,” a familiar yet far stronger cold, so intense it felt like it could freeze all the blood in her body, came surging from behind!

“BOOM!!!!!”

It was as if a gate had suddenly opened to the legendary, endlessly frozen ice plains. The temperature of the entire underground space began to drop at an almost insane speed!

Almost at the same time, the only connection to the outside. The massive steel door, heavily reinforced by the survivors in every way they could, let out a terrifying, almost wailing roar!

“THUD!!!!!!!!”

Damn it! The pursuers were really here!

With just one strike, the unknown attack from outside caused the entire door to visibly bend inward. Sasha jumped in shock, and the soldiers guarding the entrance, who had been holding their weapons, ready to fight at any moment, turned pale instantly.

They didn’t even have time to think about the sudden wave of freezing air from behind. Instead, they rushed forward, risking their lives to stop the door from being broken!

Their courage was worthy of praise, but…

They were far too slow.

Almost right after the first hit landed, before the survivors could make any real response, another deafening crash followed. The metal door, already visibly caved in, completely shattered under a terrifying, overwhelming force!

“BANG!!!!!!!”

The violent shockwave instantly crushed the survivors’ last line of defense. The raging air it kicked up turned into a wild storm, blowing everyone near the entrance flying in all directions and throwing their formation into chaos!

This was crushing power, far beyond what any human could possibly handle. Just as Valentia had predicted, all the preparations and resistance the survivors had struggled to put together were meaningless in the face of true, absolute violence. They collapsed at the first touch.

But at this moment, the attacker had no time to care about such minor obstacles.

Sensing the rapidly dropping temperature inside the room, the cloaked figure turned into a blur of violent motion, stirring up a fierce wind as it charged straight toward the vampire girl!

“V-Valentia! It’s here!!!”

As the last line of defense by Valentia’s side, Sasha drew her bow without hesitation. But under the massive pressure that made it hard to breathe just from the enemy’s presence alone, her desperate resistance looked almost laughable. She clenched her teeth, struggling to do something, when she suddenly heard a sharp shout from behind!

“Miss Sasha! Grab my hand! Now!!”

Without even thinking, feeling the terrifying threat of death rushing straight at her, the brown-haired girl instinctively stepped back two paces and tightly grabbed the soft, slender hand that reached out to her at the critical moment!

“!?”

In an instant, a shock-like sensation ran through Sasha’s body, as if she had suddenly connected to something. The world in front of her began to frost over.

Snow and wind drifted through the air.

The ultimate mystery, long sealed in ice… the gates have opened

Before everything fully sank into eternal frozen silence, the brown-haired girl suddenly looked up and saw the figure charging straight toward them.

The hood hiding the person’s face was blown half open by the raging storm, revealing long ice-blue hair that shimmered faintly with light. Ribbons flew wildly, and on that breathtakingly beautiful face was a mix of anger and shock, along with a deep, unmistakable urgency.

And then came a clear, ringing shout, unmistakably the voice of a young woman.

“Stop!!!!”
