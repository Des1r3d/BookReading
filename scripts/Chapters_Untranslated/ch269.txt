Chapter 269: Apostle of the 【Forbidden】

Just as Sasha had said, no matter how dangerous They was, or how terrible the future and consequences might be, right now there was simply no way for them to deal with it.

In this so-called 【Forbidden Domain】, where all powers were sealed, even the mysterious woman, who had shown terrifying strength before, had been reduced to almost an ordinary person.

Meanwhile, their enemy was something that seemed hard to restrain even by the power of this place itself. Just hearing about it sounded frightening. No matter how they thought about it, the three of them alone had no chance at all…

“No! There is a way!”

The mysterious woman suddenly shouted, startling Miss Sasha.

When Sasha met the other woman’s direct gaze, eyes burning with certainty and leaving no room for doubt, her heart began to race, and her scalp tingled with unease.

“W-what are you doing? I’m warning you, don’t come up with some crazy idea…”

As if she hadn’t heard the brown-haired girl’s weak protest, the mysterious woman turned her head to look at the raging black flames chasing behind them. Then she quickly looked back at Sasha. While still sliding at high speed in that ridiculous posture, she spoke seriously.

“Why do you think that thing appeared here? Why is it chasing us so relentlessly? What is it truly seeking, truly craving?”

“Is it me? Or the vampire girl over there? No! What it really wants is obviously you!”

“Although I still cannot understand you, and I even doubt your identity and motives, there is no question that you possess an extraordinary compatibility with the 【Forbidden】. The ability to connect with it, even resonate with it. In this world, such a trait should be impossible for any living being, even for gods.”

“Uh…”

Even after hearing all this, the brown-haired girl only scratched her head awkwardly, showing no sign of explaining or confessing anything. The mysterious woman fell silent for a moment, then continued,

“Just as I said before, there is solid evidence that They are trying to devour and absorb the unspeakable 【Forbidden】 buried deep beneath this land, in order to gain even more terrifying, world-shaking power. That process may have already made some progress, but it will never be easy.”

“Because They do not possess compatibility with the 【Forbidden】. No matter how unbelievable or powerful They are, They still cannot escape the category of a ‘being of this world.’ This is something deeper than soul or bloodline, carved into the very nature of all things, their origin.”

“But you are different. You should also be a being of this world, yet you possess an incredible compatibility with the 【Forbidden】 that should not exist at all. Everything that just happened clearly proves this.”

“As an apostle of the 【Forbidden】, if They can devour you, it will greatly help Them in fully absorbing that unspeakable power capable of overturning this world. That is why They has been chasing us so persistently, even forcing Their way through the restrictions of the 【Forbidden Domain】. Do you understand now?”

“H-hey… so how did such a scary-sounding identity end up being connected to me…?”

Miss Sasha scratched her head again and again, completely speechless.

Joking aside, after all the strange events that had happened recently, and after what the mysterious woman just said, Sasha seriously suspected that some evil, beyond-human, outer god had secretly set its sights on her…

Otherwise, how could a normal person be this unlucky?!

And that might be exactly why the Goddess had been paying special attention to her, even sending down divine miracles more than once to save her from danger. Maybe those two great beings were using her, a mere mortal, as a medium to fight each other from afar in ways no one could possibly understand. That so-called 【Forbidden】 compatibility might have appeared on her only because of this process.

Otherwise, how could Miss Sasha, an ordinary person through and through, who had never come into contact with anything like this before, possibly have the ability to communicate with the so-called 【Forbidden】?

This had to be some kind of mark secretly placed on her by a super evil god!

How evil!!!

Even though she had already cursed that unknown evil god, who for some reason had set its sights on her, making her unbelievably unlucky lately and almost getting her killed several times. Sasha knew very well that running around without a plan like this was clearly not a long-term solution.

This eternally frozen world was filled with extremely strong rule-based power. It suppressed all beings who entered it equally. No matter how powerful someone was, here they were almost no different from an ordinary person.

That meant every single move they made continuously drained a huge amount of physical strength. Under such intense movement, it was impossible to keep going for long.

Even if they had used clever tricks to temporarily increase the distance from the black flames, sooner or later it would catch up to them. Maybe, as the mysterious woman had said, forcing its way through the rules also cost the enemy a lot, and it might not be able to keep this up forever. But Sasha could not gamble her life on such an uncertain guess.

Instead of waiting until they were completely exhausted and unable to run, only to be killed without any chance to fight back, it was better to take a risk now. Their chances of survival might actually be higher.

After all… she still had a “trump card” hidden close to her chest!

Thinking this, Sasha turned her head to look at the truly reliable companion nearby. She found that Valentia had already put away her excitement and playful attitude at some point, returning to her calm, steady, and intelligent demeanor. At that moment, Valentia was also silently observing Sasha, and their eyes met.

Clearly, she had quietly listened to the entire conversation just now and had understood and realized many important things from it.

“What do you think, Lady Valentia?”

Hearing the deeper meaning and trust hidden behind this simple question, the vampire girl fell silent for a moment, then nodded slightly.

“As long as Miss Sasha believes it can work, I am willing to give my full support and assistance. Words alone may sound empty, but in the name of Valentia Constantius, and sworn by Origin Blood, I will never betray a companion who fights beside me, even if the price is my life.”

“Well said!”

Moved by this oath, calm on the surface, yet carrying deep weight that only those who truly understood vampires could grasp, the cloaked mysterious woman spoke up loudly before Sasha could reply.

Immediately after, she made a move that surprised the other two.

She lifted her hood, revealing the stunningly beautiful face hidden beneath it, along with long, ice-blue hair flowing down.

The eight-petaled ice-and-snow symbol clearly engraved deep within her eyes made Valentia and the other girl pause in shock. Before they could speak, the woman declared proudly.

“Worthy indeed of being a descendant of the Vampire Ancestor Constantius! Just for those words alone, even if we all manage to leave this place alive, I will never lay a hand on either of you again!”

“This is recognition in the name of Sinong!”
