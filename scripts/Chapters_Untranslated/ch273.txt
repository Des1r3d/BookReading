Chapter 273: The Forbidden One Called Light

Who is speaking?

Soft laughter slowly echoed, but Sasha’s blurred awareness, sunk deep in nothingness, could not tell where it came from. She could not even understand what the sounds meant when the words came together.

She could only hear it, passively receiving the message.

Until the next moment…

A burning, scorching pain suddenly exploded within her senses!

“ZZzz—!!!”

It was like someone who was sleeping deeply being splashed in the face with cold water. The awareness trapped in nothingness was violently shaken awake. Pain rushed in at once, pain like skin being burned, muscles being torn apart, even reaching deep into the soul itself. The girl cried out without thinking!

“Waaah!!??”

In that instant, her awareness surfaced, and she woke up completely!

“Miss Sasha!”

The girl suddenly opened her eyes, like someone seriously ill sitting up in shock. The first thing she sensed was a familiar, excited shout, and a hug full of faint, pleasant fragrance coming straight at her!

“W–wah…!?”

Soft, overwhelming pressure pressed against her, wrapping her head and face completely. The nearly suffocating softness left Sasha confused, shocked, and at a loss for words.

She tried to mumble something, but a strong burning sensation suddenly came from somewhere in her body again, cutting off her thoughts.

She quickly and gently pushed away Valentia’s excited hug and lowered her head to look at the source of that strange heat.

It was coming from… Her right hand.

“This is…?”

Sasha clearly saw that on the back of her right hand, there was a familiar-looking golden symbol, as if it had been drawn directly with pure light. It was shining with a holy, bright glow.

The intense heat followed the rhythm of the symbol’s light, spreading wave after wave through her entire body, soaking into her soul and its very core. It felt like scraping poison from the bones. Painful and hard to endure, yet truly driving away the deep cold that had already eaten into her soul after touching the 【Black Flame】 and the 【Forbidden】.

“Th-this… what’s going on?”

“You did it! You really did it, Miss Sasha! Look! The black flames are fading!”

At some point, Valentia had come to her side. She excitedly shook Sasha’s shoulders. Following the direction she pointed, Sasha instinctively looked around.

Only then did she realize, just as Valentia said, the pitch-black flames that should have been right next to her, only one step away from swallowing her whole, were completely gone. From the surroundings, it seemed she was still in the same place as before. Only now she was lying on the ground instead of standing.

“That’s impossible…”

Sasha lowered her head again, staring blankly at her body, which was completely intact. There was not even a single trace of blood.

All the pain she had gone through, her conversation with the unbelievable girl within the black flames, the clear and all-knowing state she reached after understanding the 【Forbidden】, and the unwillingness and helplessness she felt when facing an unavoidable, fate-like ending.

All of these memories were clearly carved into her soul. Yet now, they felt like an illusion reflected by reality itself, filling the girl with a deep sense of absurd unreality.

“So, from your point of view… what exactly happened?”

As if noticing Miss Sasha’s obvious inner shock, Valentia instinctively exchanged a look with the Snow Girl, who had also come over and looked quietly excited about their success. The Snow Girl did not try to hide anything and spoke up right away.

“We only saw you turn around and walk straight toward it. Just as you were about to collide, a golden light suddenly burst out from your body and shot into the sky.”

“That light was incredibly bright, so bright we could barely keep our eyes open. We don’t know what really happened at that moment, but after the golden light faded, the black flames were completely gone. The only thing left was you, lying on the ground.”

The vampire girl nodded again and again and quickly added,

“Yes, yes. We rushed over to check on you right away. In the end, we saw that you didn’t seem hurt at all, just… like you had fallen asleep.”

“At first we weren’t sure whether we should wake you up. We didn’t understand why you had fallen asleep, and we were afraid that doing something carelessly might affect you. Then, all of a sudden, you screamed and sat up by yourself…”

“Golden… light?”

The girl whispered in shock.

Unbelievable confusion and absurdity crashed into her mind like a rising tide.

Almost without thinking, her eyes fell once more on the back of her right hand. The burning, stabbing pain was still there, yet it caused no real damage. Instead, it seemed to be the source of everything that had changed, the golden rune.

In fact, Sasha had seen this rune before. She knew very well where it came from.

Back then, in Saint Tyr City of the Holy Empire, it was Mr. Tairnak, who, despite being a Behemoth tribal chief, firmly believed in the Goddess, who personally drew it on her using an unknown medicine given by Miss Violet.

That moment was one of the most unbelievable and shocking events Sasha had ever experienced in her life, no less overwhelming than what had just happened. Because of that, she remembered almost every detail clearly. Especially this rune, which had once given her unmatched power, like a symbol of the goddess herself.

Sasha had always thought it was some kind of mark closely tied to the goddess, similar to the markings given to those who passed the Chosen Hero trials. But…

Only now, seeing it again in such an unexpected moment, did Sasha finally realize its true nature.

This was not a symbol or a divine mark at all.

It was a word.

A word of the 【Forbidden】.

And after everything she had just experienced, Sasha now fully understood its meaning.

“Light.”

“The Goddess… of Light? But why…”

No matter how hard it was to believe or understand, Sasha had to accept the clear truth before her.

It was that goddess, the one who represents the Primordial Light, worshipped as the true god by countless followers of the Goddess Church, who had saved her.

Just like in Saint Tyr City before, and like in the hidden passage beneath the tavern long ago, the goddess had once again reached out to help her. And the 【Forbidden】, which Sasha had once believed stood above all gods and all existence as an absolute, unbreakable law, was forced to give way under that divine light.

That goddess did not fear the 【Forbidden】 at all. In fact, the more Sasha thought about it, the more frightening the idea became. She might have already mastered part of the power of the 【Forbidden】 itself. Otherwise, how could she write rules using 【Forbidden Words】, and now pull Sasha back from the absolute nothingness ruled by the 【Forbidden】?

Although there were countless questions she still could not understand, at least one thing was very clear to Sasha.

Everything she had experienced up to now was not an illusion and not a lie.

The 【Forbidden】 authority she had risked her life to take from the black flames was still inside this body and within the very core of her soul. It was just that…

“……”

The girl gently opened and closed her fingers, sensing that 【Forbidden】 power. Something that could not be spoken of or described, something that should never have been able to exist inside a physical body.

Very soon, she understood.

It was strange. Even though all the memories were still clear in Sasha’s mind, those sealed truths, the untouchable beings and traces, could no longer be understood at their deepest level. She could remember them, but she could not truly comprehend them anymore.

Her understanding had been blocked. Or rather, although the current Sasha had survived with the goddess’s help, she had temporarily lost most of the authority and status granted by the 【Forbidden】.

This was the unavoidable price of survival.

However, those powers had not been taken away by the goddess. They still belonged to the girl. Using methods Sasha still could not understand, the goddess had gathered all the 【Forbidden】 power and sealed it onto the back of her hand, within those patterns also written in 【Forbidden Words】.

Back then, Chief Tairnak had exhausted himself to write the word “Light” under the goddess’s guidance. And 【Forbidden Words】 were never tied only to the body.

Their existence had long been deeply carved into Sasha’s soul and her very being.

That was why she possessed the impossible 【Forbidden】 compatibility. Even though the great battle that destroyed the city had used up most of the power contained in that word, it still existed. It was just that Sasha, as a mortal, could not sense or realize it.

And earlier, when she seized a large amount of 【Forbidden】 authority from the black flames, whether it was the 【Forbidden】 controlled by the goddess or the power held by the black flames, they were most likely… from the same source.

After receiving such a great refill of power, the rune that had long lost its strength and faded away was able to shine once more. And this, precisely, became the key that allowed Sasha to survive by sheer luck today.

“Ha… this really makes one shiver without realizing it… This is what a true god is.”

At last, after believing she had sorted out the whole chain of events, the brown-haired girl stood up with her companions’ support and let out a long breath.

But her expression only grew more complicated.

She did not understand why it had to be her, yet everything now clearly connected together.

From beginning to end, everything had been under that goddess’s control.

As early as Saint Tyr City, when the goddess guided Chief Tairnak to write that 【Forbidden Word】, she already knew that today’s events would happen. A year or two might feel very long to mortals, but to a true god, it was only two linked points in a vast, carefully laid plan.

To cross time itself, to see cause and effect, past and future, and to hold all changes of the world in one’s hand, what kind of immense and terrifying wisdom was that?

Sasha could not even imagine what level of existence one would need to reach to control everything within such a vast river of time.

She certainly could not. Even the girl within the black flames was far, far from it.

Only Her… only She was truly the all-knowing, all-powerful master.
