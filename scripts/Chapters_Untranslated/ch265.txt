Chapter 265: The Lotus Flower Blooming from Ice and Frost

“Boom boom boom boom boom!!!!!!”

Led by the golden flame spear, a vast sea of fire rolled back toward the 【Frostflow】. It was like two clearly divided armies crashing into each other on a battlefield. Waves of fire surged, icy frost flew everywhere, and endless explosions tore through the air!

In truth, the 【Frostflow】 was not completely helpless against the golden flames. But the key problem was that it lacked a sharp core, something to lead and gather its power. In contrast, the holy spear burning with fierce fire charged forward like an unstoppable blade, tearing apart anything that dared to block its path and driving straight through!

And so, the suppressed 【Frostflow】 began to retreat.

It might not have a true “self,” existing only as a natural force, like a flood breaking through a dam or thunder falling from the sky. Or perhaps there really was some unseen will secretly guiding and controlling its power. Either way, when faced with an even stronger and more violent force, its retreat was unavoidable.

Wherever the golden flames passed, the frozen stone walls and ground melted again, revealing their original dark gray surfaces.

All the effects left behind by the 【Frostflow】 were forcefully erased. Even the members of the Temple who had been turned into ice statues one after another returned to their normal forms.

Those blazing and grand golden flames did not burn their bodies away. Instead, they carefully removed the terrifying cold poison left by 【Extreme Cold】. A curse that no mortal method could normally cure. All that remained were people just freed from the ice, staring at each other in shock and confusion.

Only when the golden flames pushed the 【Frostflow】 deep into the tunnel, disappearing together into the darkness from which it had come, did the black-haired girl calmly withdraw her hand. The golden wall of light, tall and firm like a city wall, slowly faded away as well.

Bathed in the glow of her bright white wings and the majestic holy spirit behind her, she turned slightly and looked at Kellian Sinong, the only one who had witnessed everything from beginning to end.

Those same clean, silver-blue eyes met hers. It was as if all the greatness and miracles shown earlier had not affected the girl at all, as if she had simply picked up a teacup and gently put it down, nothing more than an easy, casual action.

Her calm and clear gaze carried no pressure or authority. Though it was certainly memorable, under normal circumstances, the High Priestess would never have linked this quiet girl with the godlike act she had just seen, an act that had nearly saved countless lives by herself.

“……”

Kellian opened her mouth without thinking, but whether because her body had already reached its limit and was held together only by sheer will, or because she was too nervous under that holy light, she could not say a single word.

Seeing her awkward state, the black-haired girl gently shook her head. She did not blame the High Priestess for her lack of manners or for staring so directly. Instead, she raised her hand and lightly flicked a small spark of starlight, which drifted softly into Kellian’s chest, still frozen solid with ice. After giving her a quiet look, the girl turned away.

“Wait—”

Before the High Priestess could speak in her shock, the two girls who had appeared from nowhere stepped forward. With just one step, they vanished as if slipping into nothingness.

“Ah… Lady Kellian!!!”

Only then did the Temple’s warriors, just freed from the ice and still confused, finally notice their leader, who had been thrown far away. They rushed over and gathered around the High Priestess, yet not a single one of them seemed to notice the two girls who had just disappeared.

“What… what just happened? High Priest, why did the cold wave suddenly vanish?”

“Yes! We were clearly about to be—”

“……”

Listening to her subordinates talking over each other, their faces full of relief and confusion after surviving disaster, Kellian stayed silent for a moment and took a deep breath.

She could feel the near-fatal injuries inside her body healing at incredible speed. All her conditions were not only restored to their peak but even felt slightly stronger than before. She simply shook her head and, with support from others, slowly stood up.

“Come with me. We… still have things that must be done.”

………………………………………

“Whoosh~”

Light and shadow flashed. When the two girls stepped out of nothingness, they had already arrived in a completely different place.

At the end of the passage, the holy spear of light that had shot forward earlier was now stuck straight into something that looked like a crystal made of extreme ice, buried all the way to the hilt.

The golden light-flames around it were still burning strongly, but compared to before, their power and pressure had clearly weakened. Instead, centered on the holy spear, they had formed a huge wall of fire, wrapping the crystal of extreme cold completely inside and blocking its icy presence from leaking out.

There was no doubt. This was the source of the terrifying 【Frostflow】 from earlier.

“Wow, this really caused quite a scene~”

Violet stood outside the thin, wing-like curtain of fire and looked at the fantasy-like sight before her. Even with her wide experience as a priestess, she could not help but raise an eyebrow in surprise.

Yes, it was indeed an ice crystal, but its size…

…was so huge that it could completely cover the entire main building of Ice Lotus Castle.

Deep underground, it had spread and expanded violently, propping open an extremely vast space and freezing everything within reach, living beings, the ground, the walls, everything.

Violet could even see at least several hundred figures dressed like assassins, frozen in all kinds of poses at the exact moment they were caught. Not far from them were dozens of people in different clothes, clearly survivors who had fled here earlier from the banquet hall, also sealed inside this unbelievably massive block of ice.

“Master, it seems Valentia isn’t here?”

The priestess nodded slightly, a smile appearing on her face.

“And I also don’t see the one who should be here, the so-called mastermind. To avoid even this level of impact… she really does have some skill.”

The Dragon God did not fully understand her master’s meaning, but she did not mind and continued to ask,

“So what do we do now? Do we keep watching and wait?”

Violet shook her head.

“That’s no longer possible. I don’t know exactly what happened here, but there’s a very high chance this was Valentia’s doing. She flipped the chessboard first, and once that happened, everyone else could only move along with the change.”

“When it’s time to act, you must decide fast. Holding back too much can really ruin the key moment.”

“No wonder you acted directly, Master…”

Thinking about this, Xiao Guang raised an eyebrow, still a bit confused.

“But how do you know this was done by Valentia? No matter how you look at it, the people who invaded this castle seem more likely to do something like this, right?”

“Heh, they don’t have that kind of ability, and they don’t have the courage either~”

The priestess smiled and shook her head helplessly.

“A God&apos;s power can only be countered by another God. Valentia may look well-behaved and easy to bully, but if you really push her too far… she’s someone who would do anything.”

As she spoke, she gave Xiao Guang a look. Xiao Guang immediately understood, nodded, and lightly waved her hand. The golden wall of fire that floated in front of them like a seal smoothly split open, forming a doorway just wide enough for one person to pass through.

The true power of the 【Primordial Flame】 was naturally far greater than what was shown so far. However, this block of extreme ice had expanded far too much. If it were destroyed or erased directly, the shock might cause the entire Ice Lotus Castle above to collapse. Because she realized this, the priestess restrained the fire’s power and chose a sealing method instead.

The Dragon God walked in front. She did not even need to actively attack. The golden flames rising naturally from her body melted the extreme ice ahead, opening a perfectly sized path.

The two girls stepped inside one after the other, and the wall of fire behind them quietly closed again.

Frost mist filled the air. The ultimate cold, like the physical form of “law”, surged in from all directions at once. Yet it was completely blocked by the invisible pressure naturally spreading from the two girls, unable to touch them at all.

The priestess looked around with clear interest, her lips slowly curving into a faint smile.

“Alright, let’s see what kind of big secret is hiding beneath this 【Extreme Cold】, shall we~”

………………………………………

When she regained consciousness, Sasha found herself standing in a world that looked strange and unreal.

It was a world made of ice and frost.

From the tall mountains in the distance that rose into the clouds, to the ancient trees standing across the land, and even to the fish in the water and the birds in the sky. Everything she could see was made of pure, clear ice crystal.

They were like still statues, as if every part of the world had been carved from extreme ice. It also felt like a world completely frozen forever.

“My goodness…”

Looking at these unbelievably beautiful ice sculptures, the brown-haired girl could not help but let out a amazed sigh. But soon, as if she noticed something strange, she froze slightly.

She suddenly realized that this world was not just freezing objects.

The ice birds could no longer flap their wings, yet they stayed floating in the sky instead of falling down. Leaves that had fallen from the trees were frozen in midair, turned into solid ice, hanging forever between the branches and the ground without moving at all.

There was no wind, no snow. Compared to icy plains or even the Extreme Cold Zone, this place was completely silent. There was not even the slightest sound, or any sign of change. Standing here, Sasha could not even feel the cold that should have existed.

It was as if she had stepped outside this world, standing apart from space itself. Yet the icy ground under her feet clearly supported her body and weight. This strange contradiction made her feel confused and lost.

“Th-this… what is going on?”

“As you can see, if I’m not wrong, the time in this world is currently frozen.”

Sasha turned around in surprise and saw a familiar figure slowly walking out from between the ice-crystal trees. She immediately felt relieved, but soon her face filled with confusion again.

“So where exactly is this? Lady Valentia, weren’t we just in that underground secret room? How did we suddenly end up in this weird place?”

The one who appeared was, of course, the vampire girl who had escaped together with her. Compared to Sasha’s confusion, Valentia already seemed to understand the surroundings. She smiled and nodded slightly.

“We’ve been through danger together, so there’s no need to be so formal. You can just call me Valentia, Sasha… Do you remember what I said earlier?”

“Uh… so this is the space behind that wall? But… isn’t it way too big?”

The vampire girl shook her head.

“To be precise, behind that wall is only solid rock. The key point is the magic circle carved on it.”

“Based on what I’ve studied, that magic circle is likely part of a special seal. Or rather, it’s the part that can appear in physical form, allowing ordinary people to see and touch it. Its function, at least, includes acting as a connection point. A bridge that lets this world link with the outside.”

“Huh? Uh…”

Such academic and complicated words made Sasha, who only understood magic on a basic level, scratch her head without thinking. Still, she managed to catch a few key ideas and tried to understand.

“So… we passed through that wall and were teleported into this sealed space?”

“Wait, then where are the others?”

“Well… ahaha…”

When this topic came up, Valentia’s expression clearly turned awkward. But seeing the trust on Sasha’s face, she felt too embarrassed to lie and decided to tell the truth.

However, instead of explaining everything directly, the vampire girl asked a question instead.

“Sasha, do you know why Ice Lotus Castle can produce Ice Lotus. A plant that should only grow in extreme cold regions and is almost impossible to see without great luck?”

Seeing Sasha tilt her head in confusion, just as expected, Valentia reached out and gently took her hand, then turned and pointed to the place where she had appeared earlier.

“Come with me.”

Like that, the two girls walked one after the other through this strange world made entirely of extreme ice.

It was clear that Valentia had already explored the nearby area a little. Although the ice trees, ice walls, and all kinds of mixed and strange objects made the surroundings confusing, they still quickly found the right direction. Soon, they arrived at a relatively open space that looked somewhat like a plantation.

The scene in front of them made Sasha’s eyes widen instantly, and she could not help but cry out.

“Ohhh!!!”

Yes, there was an incredibly strange piece of land here. Even though it was still inside this frozen world, this dark soil, about a hundred square meters wide and spreading out in a circular shape, had somehow not been completely frozen by the extreme ice. And…

It was filled with Ice Lotus.

One after another, dense clusters of Ice Lotus grew so closely together that they seemed endless. Just a rough look showed there were at least three hundred of them.

What was even more shocking was that these were not the more common five- or six-petal Ice Lotus seen outside. Each one had at least seven petals. Among them were more than ten eight-petal Ice Lotus, and at the very center…

Two or three unbelievably beautiful Ice Lotus with nine petals.

Nine-Petaled Ice Lotus!!!

The moment she clearly saw this scene, Sasha felt as if her heart was about to jump out of her chest. Her heart pounded so hard that her head spun, and she could hardly believe her own eyes.

A 【Nine-Petaled Ice Lotus】, what did that even mean?

She had never even heard of such a thing before. Its value was beyond anything she could imagine.

After all, in the hundreds of years since Ice Lotus Castle was built, it had only ever produced one 【Eight-Petaled Ice Lotus】. That single flower was already treated by the world as a divine gift, a priceless national treasure.

Wasn’t she just hunted by a group of assassins because she heard from an information dealer that Ice Lotus Castle might soon produce another eight-petal Ice Lotus?

Even seven-petal Ice Lotus, or even the five- or six-petal ones, were treasures that most factions would fight desperately to obtain. One flower was worth a fortune.

This time, the Xavier Merchant Guild came to Ice Lotus Castle planning to use money earned from selling grain to buy a few five-petal Ice Lotus and resell them at a high price. In the southern lands, even one such Ice Lotus could earn more profit than all the grain they sold on this trip. That alone showed how precious it was.

B-but what was this?

Th-th-th-this… could it really all be…?!

Valentia did not seem surprised by the extreme shock and shaking of the girl beside her. Clearly, she had seen this scene before. She spoke calmly.

“Sasha, you’re not mistaken. These are real Ice Lotus. Their value and effects are even greater than anything you’ve seen or heard about outside. But, I don’t recommend that you take any of them.”

“Eh?”

Her calm yet firm words were like a bucket of cold water poured over Sasha’s head, instantly waking the merchant girl who had been dreaming of piles of gold and silver. Sasha froze and quickly turned to look at Valentia.

“Why?”

A faint smile flashed through the vampire girl’s blood-red eyes, but she kept her tone casual as she explained.

“Do you think Ice Lotus Castle can produce so many Ice Lotus every year because it found a blessed land like this? That’s wrong. They can’t even come here. And what you’re seeing is not some land that grows treasures…”

“It is the first crack in a massive dam, one that spreads destruction and disaster.”
