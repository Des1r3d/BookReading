Chapter 256: An Uninvited Guest

The enemies who invaded the castle were very easy to tell apart. They were clearly divided into two groups. Ordinary assassins and powerful fighters who could use something like high-level ice magic.

The stronger group was mainly responsible for wiping out all living forces inside the castle, while the ordinary assassins dealt with the remaining survivors and normal people who had little ability to resist.

It felt like… two different forces were working together to carry out this mission.

By the way, since the priestess and her companion entered the castle, they had not met a single enemy.

To be more exact, they had not met even one living person.

Just like what could be seen from outside, this castle, located in the center of a huge city and supposed to be lively and glorious, was now frighteningly quiet. The only things accompanying the two girls were the increasingly violent wind and snow outside the corridor windows, and the shattered remains scattered across the floor.

Judging from the signs of killing at the scene, the number of invaders could not have been small. Time also would not have allowed them to finish clearing the castle and then completely withdraw before the two girls arrived.

Not to mention, after paying such a huge price to invade the main fortress of Ice Lotus Castle, the attackers must have had some very important goal to complete.

Because of this, Violet was certain that the invaders were still somewhere inside the castle. It was just that the girls had not run into them yet.

She could, of course, use her spiritual sense to sweep the entire area and instantly see every hidden detail. But after being bored for so long, finally running into something this interesting, clearing everything instantly like using a cheat would be far too dull.

And honestly, compared to stepping forward and personally solving the problem, the priestess was more interested in how the different forces involved would react after such a serious incident, and what attitudes and positions they would show.

Assassinating the castle lord, then luring away defenders and attacking Ice Lotus Castle in the chaos. Everything was carried out quickly and in an orderly way. It was clearly a carefully planned and well-organized special operation.

Being able to mobilize such power, the enemy was definitely not doing all this just to kill a few people.

Taking control of the main castle was only the beginning of this operation, one necessary step to reach their goal. What came afterward was likely the real core of the plan.

If Violet appeared too early, or showed overwhelming power and a clear stance, some things that should slowly come to the surface might be scared back into hiding.

With that in mind, she did not mind holding back a little and using more basic methods to stay involved.

“So, can you find Valentia’s location?”

The dragon girl frowned slightly and wrinkled her nose. Her beautiful eyes, burning like golden flames, looked around as if searching for something. She hesitated before answering.

“The smells are too mixed up… I did find a few places where she might have stayed, but I still can’t find her herself.”

“I see…”

The priestess nodded thoughtfully.

This was not the first time she had heard a similar answer from her partner.

The two girls were not wandering around without purpose. Since entering the castle, they had been following the dragon girl’s sense of smell, tracking the last known location of the young duchess they had noticed earlier.

As the leader of the delegation, Valentia carried the key to the success or failure of the alliance between the Snow Empire and the vampire race. No matter how fierce the fighting inside the main castle had been, as long as the guards were not completely wiped out, her safety would definitely be their top priority.

On top of that, considering the power and hidden cards the girl herself possessed, Violet was not truly worried about her safety. This was also one of the main reasons why the priestess could move at such a relaxed pace.

However, just as Xiao Guang had said, although Valentia seemed to have appeared here before, after checking several places where her scent remained, they still found no clues of real value.

If Valentia were truly still inside this castle, then with the dragon girl’s sharp sense of smell, she should have been able to find her directly. If not, then perhaps it meant…

“Actually… that burst of her magic power earlier was very strong, basically a full-power move. Could it be that she met a powerful enemy, lost the fight, and was taken away?”

Hearing the Dragon God’s slightly wicked guess whispered so softly, the priestess could only shake her head helplessly.

“Try wishing her well, at least a little… Compared to that possibility, I’m more inclined to think that the girl found a very hidden place, maybe even one that can block your scent detection, and is hiding there.”

“Tsk…”

After hearing this, Xiao Guang curled her lips, her disappointment almost impossible to hide. Violet chose to pretend she did not see that expression. She cleared her throat lightly and continued.

“Ahem… anyway, let’s keep moving in the same direction as before. Even if we can’t be sure of her exact location, as long as we check all the places where her scent remains, we’ll find the right answer eventually. After all—”

Before she could finish her sentence, both girls suddenly reacted. They turned their heads toward another part of the castle corridor, then exchanged a quick glance and gave a slight nod. Without a single word, they moved at the same time, quickly slipping behind a corridor pillar in a dark corner to hide.

And just a few seconds after they made this sudden and strange move—

“Clatter, clatter, clatter—!”

For some reason, a large number of heavy footsteps suddenly poured out from the direction they had been looking at. At least a hundred neatly equipped figures formed a unit and rushed forward, quickly entering Violet’s field of view.

They were wearing armor different from the castle’s guard troops. Their armor was more refined and lighter, yet because of its higher quality, its protection was likely not weak at all. The soldiers’ armor looked bright and clean, and most of them carried easy-to-use weapons like one-handed knives and swords.

On the chest of their armor, a clearly carved ice emblem shone brightly, clearly showing where they came from. In addition, in the center of the group were about ten or so figures who were different from the rest. Even in this freezing land, they wore only light robes and held objects that were not staffs. Their identities were, in fact, obvious.

“Oh My… Snow God!”

“How did this happen… Who would dare to do something like this?!”

“This is too cruel…”

The horrifying scene of corpses covering the corridor clearly shocked them as well. Many of the soldiers, and even the robed figures in the center, could not help but whisper to each other. Only the leader seemed to have known something in advance and was not overly shaken by what she saw.

She was a woman wearing priestly robes as well, but her attire was far more complex and luxurious than the others’. She looked to be nearly thirty years old, with the calm presence of a mature adult.

She had long ice-blue hair and eyes, and a cold, sharp beauty. Behind her, faint, illusion-like ribbons of light drifted softly. She looked somewhat similar to the Holy Maiden statue that Violet had once seen in the Snowfall Hall.

Seemingly unaware that two uninvited guests were hiding nearby, the priestess swept her cold gaze across the surroundings. Her eyes lingered for a long time on the bodies of the guards frozen into shattered ice, until she finally seemed to reach a conclusion and gently closed her eyes.

“Hoo…”

When she opened them again, the brief trace of hesitation had vanished like thin smoke, leaving only firm and icy resolve.

“Follow me!”
