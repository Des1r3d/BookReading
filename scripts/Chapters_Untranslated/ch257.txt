Chapter 257: Racing Against Time

“Yes!!!”

“Clatter, clatter, clatter—!”

With the sound of heavy, rapid footsteps, the suddenly appearing unit continued moving deeper into the castle and quickly vanished once more at the far end of the corridor.

Only then did the two girls who had been watching from the shadows finally step out. They looked toward the direction where the group had disappeared, then glanced at each other.

“…They are officers and Seal Wielders from the Eternal Winter Temple.”

The priestess, already familiar with the traits of this group, made an immediate and accurate judgment.

“Judging by their clothing, equipment, and aura, they are all high-ranking followers of the Temple. There’s a very high chance this is the main force of the Eternal Winter Temple stationed at Ice Lotus Fortress.”

The dragon girl nodded slightly, but then showed a puzzled expression.

“Why would the Temple’s main force suddenly appear inside the main castle, which is under official control? And from the way they reacted, it seems they didn’t know what happened here, and they’re not the ones who did it. But if they rushed here after receiving the news, wouldn’t that response be way too fast?”

“Mm… there really is something suspicious here~”

The black-haired girl narrowed her eyes slightly, a smile forming at the corner of her lips.

Not only that, this unit was at least a hundred people strong. Yet from the moment they sensed the group’s presence, reacted, and then saw them arrive, only a few seconds had passed. With the strength of the two girls, this was clearly abnormal.

It wasn’t that Violet or Xiao Guang had failed to sense such a large number of people approaching. Rather, the group’s appearance was simply far too sudden.

This unit definitely did not enter the castle through the main gate they had used earlier, nor through any normal outside entrance. Most likely, they arrived through a secret passage, or even by special means such as spatial teleportation.

Even so, there were still many strange points that did not add up.

Heh… it seems the interesting things hidden under the surface are finally starting to show themselves.

How this chaos will eventually turn out is truly something to look forward to.

Seeing her master remain silent, the Dragon God looked around and tried to make a suggestion.

“The exit of the secret passage they used should be somewhere nearby. Master, maybe we could go take a look…”

“No, there’s no need.”

Shaking her head, Violet rejected the idea without hesitation.

“Whether it’s a secret passage or something else that connects the two places doesn’t really matter. The key point is simply that such a thing exists. Its exact form isn’t important. Do you understand what I mean?”

“…?”

Clearly confused, Xiao Guang froze for a moment. After a short pause, she nodded, half-understanding, then quickly asked again.

“Alright… then what do we do now? Do we keep searching for Valentia the same way as before?”

The priestess shook her head once more, then smiled lightly.

“Of course not. We follow them. Since there’s a ready-made guide right in front of us, it would be a waste not to make good use of it~”

………………………………

Kellian Sinong was in a very bad mood.

Aside from being the highest priestess of the Eternal Winter Temple in this place, this snow woman, who had been in charge of the Temple’s affairs at Ice Lotus Fortress since the castle was first built, actually had another background as well.

She was one of the members of a very special inner organization within the Eternal Winter Temple, known as the 【Holy Maiden Advisory Council】.

When it comes to the 【Holy Maiden Advisory Council】, most followers of the Eternal Winter Temple have probably never even heard of it. That is because it is a secret organization, personally created by the first Eternal Winter Holy Maiden, Winter Sinong, the founder of the Temple and the true daughter of the Snow God, and passed down through generations by her hidden orders.

As its name suggests, the main duty of the 【Holy Maiden Advisory Council】 is to assist each generation’s Holy Maiden with certain necessary tasks, so that she can better fulfill her role as High Priest. After all, no single person’s thoughts or decisions can be correct forever. Only through restraint and balance can the Eternal Winter Temple continue to develop in a healthy way.

Although the Council does not hold open political power within the Temple, it fully oversees the most critical parts of the Holy Maiden Trials, including the succession of the 【Divine Ice and Snow Seal】 and many deep secrets. One could say this special organization is like a shadow beneath the Holy Maiden’s light, or a blade hanging above her head. In the most extreme situations, it even has the authority to remove a High Priest from their position.

That said, the identities of most Council members are extremely well hidden. Aside from a few who openly manage the trials, almost no one knows how many members actually exist. Even during succession, new members are personally chosen and trained by current ones, passing the duty down generation after generation while remaining in the shadows.

Only when the current Holy Maiden makes a serious mistake, one that could bring disaster to the Temple or even the entire northern world. do all members of the 【Holy Maiden Advisory Council】 truly gather together to discuss the situation and take special action.

In fact, as far as Kellian knows, many Council members, including her own teacher, never once used this hidden authority throughout their entire lives. The Holy Maiden’s real power is enormous, and the 【Holy Maiden Advisory Council】 exists only as a final safeguard.

Kellian became the highest priestess of Ice Lotus Fortress purely through her own ability and experience. Her position had nothing to do with her status as a Council member. However, as part of this secret group working in the shadows, she truly knew certain truths that were absolute secrets to outsiders, and even to most believers.

These were secrets her teacher passed to her alone, spoken only at the moment of death, about the real reason why the first Holy Maiden secretly created the 【Holy Maiden Advisory Council】 and gave it the power to restrain future Holy Maidens.

Because of this knowledge, when Kellian followed the Holy Maiden named 【Snowfall】 to this land, before it was even called Ice Lotus Fortress, she was able to see deeper truths behind appearances and take careful preventive measures in advance.

Later events proved her judgment correct. Not long after 【Snowfall】 returned to the headquarters, she stepped down from her position and vanished without a trace. To prevent further uncertainty here, Kellian gave up a chance to rise even higher in rank and instead chose to remain at the newly built Ice Lotus Fortress, guarding it from the shadows.

She had guarded it for nearly a hundred years.

The Snow race, especially pure-blooded Snow Girls, have extremely long lifespans, sometimes reaching even a thousand years.

Now, decades later, Kellian had become the highest priestess of the local Temple branch through her own strength. Yet what truly brought her peace of mind was that the things hidden underground remained stable, and the measures within Ice Lotus Fortress had proven effective, gradually forming a complete and stable system.

She once imagined continuing this quiet watch until she grew tired, or until her life finally came to an end, then passing her duties and her identity as a Council member to a successor, thus fulfilling the responsibility of her generation.

However…

The sudden outbreak of the Ice Tide in the far north changed everything. Even this southern land, which should have been very far from the battlefield, was clearly affected.

From the moment the Earth Seal was destroyed by an unknown powerful being, and the Snowfall Hall was invaded… no, perhaps from even earlier, from the time news arrived that Holy Maiden Nolan Sinong had fallen in the far north. The box that sealed disaster and misfortune had already been completely opened.

Over the past few days, she had been carefully investigating three things.

the monsters that suddenly appeared beneath Snowfall Hall, the invasion that happened there, and Miss Violet, the priestess whom the 【Holy Seal Wielder】 Silin said had stepped in to help.

Using the vast influence of the Temple, the priestess quickly gathered a large amount of useful information. However, the more she thought about it and connected the pieces together, the more frightened Kellian became.

She began to feel that one, or even several, terrifying and mysterious powers had appeared within Ice Lotus Fortress. Although their exact relationships were still too complex to judge, their target was very likely the deepest secret of this place. The one she had been guarding for decades.

This was far too serious to act rashly. The priestess did not dare make any bold moves. She could only urgently contact some of the other 【Holy Maiden Advisory Council】 members she knew, and at the same time gather as many powerful Temple members within the fortress as possible, keeping them ready to respond at any moment.

Kellian had a strong feeling that if someone truly planned to act, it would happen before the Ice Lotus Exhibition was held, and before the Pegasus Knight Order from the capital arrived. Because of this, she had gone nowhere these past few days, personally staying near the still-intact Earth Seals beneath Snowfall Hall, guarding against any surprise.

As for the priestess named Violet, since she made no real effort to hide herself, the Temple easily uncovered her “great achievements” in the southern world.

The Goddess Church and the Eternal Winter Temple are the two most influential religions in the world, and they have always stayed out of each other’s affairs. Because of this, the Temple treats anything related to the Goddess Church with extreme caution.

Although Violet openly claimed to have nothing to do with the Goddess Church, and was even labeled as the so-called strongest holy caster outside the Church, a simple look into her past, such as her unclear relationship with a current God’s Knight, the years they traveled together, and the Church’s attitude toward her, was enough to make many things obvious, even without hard proof.

For this reason, after careful consideration, Kellian chose not to contact Violet directly. Instead, she sent a subordinate of second-highest rank to represent Snowfall Hall and offer an apology at the guest lodge.

In Kellian’s view, no matter how much the Goddess Church or Violet herself knew about the situation here, judging by their usual way of handling matters, they had no reason to interfere with the Temple over this issue. Therefore, they could be treated as neutral for the time being and set aside.

With this assumption, Kellian focused most of her attention on defending the Earth Seals. In her opinion, since those mysterious forces within Ice Lotus Fortress had already tested Snowfall Hall once, their next target would very likely be this place.

But…

“Did I guess wrong…? Hurry! Faster!”

Leading a group of Temple elites, the High Priestess was now rushing through the castle corridors, which were littered with corpses.

The Snow Empire’s official forces, led by the fortress lord, the Count, were without doubt the strongest open power in Ice Lotus Fortress. Therefore, when the fortress was first established, he naturally held the largest share of that object.

Kellian had imagined many possible ways the mysterious forces might act, but she never considered that they would directly assassinate the fortress lord and attack, even slaughter the entire main castle. This was almost the same as a desperate, self-destructive gamble, a move aimed at overturning the entire Snow Empire, where success meant everything and failure meant total ruin.

Just like in battle, no one uses their strongest, life-or-death move at the very first strike. Normally, one would test the opponent first, learn their strength, and only then decide the next step.

On top of that, with the disappearance of Nolan Sinong, the relationship between the Eternal Winter Temple and the Snow Empire’s royal family had become subtly tense. Because of this, Kellian had not informed the fortress lord in advance, and had instead treated the royal family as a party that also required caution.

Perhaps it was precisely these small but critical misjudgments that finally led to the tragic scene now unfolding.

When she felt the violent shock coming from the other side of the Earth Seal, she was truly shocked. She even wondered if this might be the enemy’s trick to lure her away.

But after thinking it over again and again, the priestess still split her forces. She left about half of the troops behind, placing them under the command of the Western Forest Seal Envoy, whose strength and status were second only to her own, to continue guarding the area. She then led the remaining elites and rushed out using an emergency special teleportation array.

Kellian had to make sure that the items held by the royal family inside the main castle would not fall into the hands of people with bad intentions. Even the slightest chance of that happening was a risk she could not afford.

“Move! Faster!”

Urging them on in a low but urgent voice, the priestess took the lead without any hesitation at all, guiding the unit straight toward a specific direction inside the castle.

Others might not know where important things were hidden in the main castle, but Kellian was different. She had followed Holy Maiden 【Snowfall】 to this place and had taken part in nearly every key moment of that past incident. Her understanding of Ice Lotus Fortress was even deeper than that of the Count, whose title had already been passed down for two generations.

“Bang!!!”

Without hesitation, Kellian kicked open the half-closed main doors and led the group straight into the banquet hall used to receive honored guests. A wave of blood-filled stench, far stronger than outside, rushed out at them at once.

“Ugh…!”

“My god… how could it be this cruel…”

“…May your souls return to the embrace of wind and snow.”

Faced with the thick smell of blood and the horrifying scene before their eyes, some of the less experienced clergy couldn’t help but gag softly. Even the veteran elites, including the High Priestess herself, looked grim. They silently closed their eyes, clenched a fist, and placed it over their chests, lowering their heads.

This was a mourning ritual of the Temple, used to pray to the Snow God and wish peace for the dead. It was normally performed only after large-scale disasters, or when especially respected figures had passed away.

…It was too brutal.

The entire banquet hall was filled with bodies. Everywhere one looked, there were people who had clearly been dead for some time. Soldiers, castle servants, and many kinds of guests along with their attendants. Even a quick count suggested there were hundreds.

Walls, lamps, tables, chairs, nearly every piece of furniture was splashed deep red with blood. Unlike the almost one-sided slaughter outside, a very fierce battle had clearly taken place here. And the most important proof of that was the bodies that had finally appeared. Those belonging to the attackers, who did not come from this place.
