Chapter 267: Divine Remains

“I’m just saying… could you powerful people use some normal words when you talk? Words that normal people can understand? It’s really hard for me to keep up like this…”

Sasha scratched her head helplessly. She clearly still did not understand those things that sounded impressive at first, but made no sense at all to people who did not know about them. Beside her, Valentia’s expression suddenly changed. She quickly turned to look at the burning stone monument, at the symbols she could not understand at all.

“Wait… this is actually… the legendary 【Forbidden Words】?”

The cloaked woman snorted and finally shifted her gaze toward the vampire girl, who had been less noticed until now.

“What else could it be? If she had successfully read the 【Forbidden Words】 just now, the first one to be affected would have been you, since you were the closest. Even if you do have some ability, enough to open the sealed 【Forbidden】 area by yourself, that kind of power is nothing compared to facing the 【Forbidden】 itself.”

“At that point, do you really think you would have been fine?”

“……”

Valentia did not fully trust what this enemy said, but she had to admit that everything that had happened, the strange signs and unbelievable changes, were indeed far beyond what was normal. She could not help but frown slightly.

As someone skilled in dealing with people, Valentia was usually very good at judging others. With Sasha, her newly made friend, she could clearly feel her open and honest nature.

People like that usually do not lie easily, unless their acting skills are so strong that they can even fool themselves, and everything shown so far was just a fake surface. Only then could Valentia be wrong.

But… that would be terrifying.

The vampire girl did not dare, nor did she want, to believe such a possibility.

As she had said before, Valentia reached out to Sasha in that dangerous moment because she trusted her, and brought her to this hidden place. Among so many survivors, only Sasha had gained her true trust. Yet…

The 【Forbidden Words】 carried a meaning that was far too frightening. As a vessel of Origin Blood, with an unspeakable existence sealed within her body, Valentia had personally felt the soul-shaking terror it brought. She understood what the 【Forbidden】 truly meant.

Because of that, she had to be extremely careful with anything related to it, and always consider the worst possible outcome.

Feeling the questioning and doubtful gaze turning toward her, Sasha’s heart tightened. Even though she still had no clear idea what was going on, she could tell from Valentia’s change in attitude that this was not something she could just brush off. She quickly raised her hand to explain.

“Hey, hey, it really wasn’t me! I swear, if I’m lying, I’m a puppy, okay?!”

Fortunately, the vampire girl remained calm and steady. She did not let this level of doubt cause conflict between them. Instead, she raised her hand again to comfort the anxious girl and spoke thoughtfully.

“Sasha, I do trust your character. But the concept and influence of the 【Forbidden】 cannot be judged by normal understanding. It’s also possible that something related to the 【Forbidden】 attached itself to you at some point without you knowing. This is a serious matter, we must find out what is really going on.”

“Otherwise, the consequences…”

As if thinking of something, Valentia exchanged a look with the woman still hidden under the cloak, whose face had never been fully revealed.

Not long ago, they had been enemies locked in a life-or-death chase. Yet now, when facing the concept called the 【Forbidden】, they seemed to silently put aside their hostility, even showing signs of cooperation.

How unbelievable was that?

And because of this, Sasha understood even more clearly that there was no room for jokes or excuses here. She had to give a reasonable explanation for all the strange things that had happened so far.

“Who did I even offend to end up like this… fine, fine. What else can I say? Whatever we do now, I’ll follow your lead.”

The brown-haired girl shook her head helplessly. Seeing her cooperate, Valentia finally relaxed a bit. Ignoring the cold, piercing gaze from beneath the cloaked woman’s hood, she was about to continue speaking.

But at that moment, her slightly relaxed expression suddenly changed!

“Watch out!!!”

“Bang!”

Wearing a complex formal dress that looked hard to move in, the vampire girl suddenly showed speed far beyond what anyone expected, speed she should not even have in this divine realm. The bat wings on her back beat hard, bursting out with great power, and with one leap she threw herself onto the brown-haired girl, knocking her to the ground.

But this was not an attack at all, quite the opposite.

“Boom!!!!”

A strong wind swept past. A wave of fire, long like a giant snake, rushed in from behind Sasha and cut straight across the place where she had been standing just moments ago. It made loud crackling sounds as sparks and flames exploded outward.

“What the hell was that thing just now?!”

Even though they hit the hard, icy ground pretty badly, neither of them was an ordinary person. Even with their power limited by this place, such a fall was not enough to truly hurt them. At worst, they just felt dizzy and shaken.

Pinned halfway under Valentia, Sasha looked up and saw the strange tongue of fire that had almost hit her. Her heart raced in fear. She quickly turned her eyes and immediately saw where the attack had come from.

It was the flaming stone monument, engraved with the so-called 【Forbidden Words】, that she had somehow “summoned” earlier!

Unbelievably, at some unknown moment, the bright red flames that had been burning strongly began to change from the inside out, as if being corrupted, turning into deep, eerie black fire.

Countless glowing 【Forbidden】 symbols trembled wildly, as if they were about to tear themselves free and enter the real world. Even the ice at the edge of the ground, previously stopped from melting, now showed signs of melting again.

Mad. Unstable.

This black fire was clearly not the same thing as the earlier red flames. It was a completely different kind of existence.

“Are you okay, Miss Sasha?”

“I—I’m fine! Um… thank you…”

Because of that sudden tackle, the two girls were now holding each other in a rather awkward position. But at this moment, neither of them had the time or mood to care. Valentia was the first to let go and stand up. Sasha quickly got up as well, brushing herself off, and both of them turned to look at the source of the attack.

“How could it be this thing…”

Looking at the fierce black flames that had replaced the original red-fire monument, flickering like a living shadow, the vampire girl’s expression became visibly serious.

She had seen this kind of fire before.

Just a few days ago, while traveling with a certain priestess at the Snowfall Hall.

That black flame, which burst out from inside an unknown monster and raged wildly, had left a very deep impression on Valentia.

Although the monster was eventually defeated and erased by Violet, that did not mean it was weak. On the contrary, the fact that it forced her to personally take action, and even use methods that were clearly extremely advanced, was proof enough of how terrifying that black flame truly was.

Violet had never explained the monster’s origin or talked about it afterward. But sometimes, saying nothing was the clearest warning.

It meant that this was a level of existence Valentia Constantius could not reach. Even knowing more would not change anything. If one ever encountered it again, the best and only choice would be…

“…Run! Now! Get out of here!!!”

……………………………

“Oh? Well, this is really…”

Deep within the extreme ice, a black-haired girl who had just arrived looked at the glowing presence before her and let out a soft, clearly pleased laugh.

In this underground space covered by absolute extreme cold, a place no normal living being could ever reach, a true 【Forbidden】 zone, she saw the real source of the massive ice structure above, like a giant castle, and of the terrifying frost flow that had nearly burst out and destroyed the entire Ice Lotus Fortress.

It was an ice crystal, no bigger than a washbasin, deeply embedded in solid rock.

The crystal was set inside a stone slab, surrounded by a complex, glowing magic circle that protected it from being torn apart by the terrible extreme cold. Endless streams of rule-level freezing power poured out from the crystal, freezing everything it touched. Objects, beings, even concepts themselves.

Without a doubt, this was something only a true god could have left behind.

But what truly caught Violet’s attention was not just the ice crystal filled with divine power. More importantly, it was the single thing sealed inside it.

It was… half of a finger, burning with bright red flames.

Or rather, a broken finger made of fire.

Even though it was sealed by a divine ice crystal so cold that it could freeze everything in the world, that broken finger, only about an inch long and from some unknown creature, was still burning.

Violet could clearly see small sparks of fire jumping inside the transparent ice crystal. Two things that should never exist together, completely opposite in nature, were somehow sharing the same space. It was hard to tell whether the ice crystal was freezing the flames, or if the endless fire was forever burning against that extreme cold.

“Master, what is this?”

Xiao Guang stood beside the priestess, also looking at the strange object with curiosity. As the controller of the 【Primordial Flame】, the Dragon God naturally paid close attention to anything related to fire. Very few things in this world could truly catch her interest, and this burning finger was clearly one of them.

Violet slowly shook her head.

“I don’t know for sure, but I can guess where it came from. Do you remember the Fire God’s Tomb we found by chance on the Icefang Island?”

“You mean…?”

“Mm…”

The girl spoke softly, as if carefully sorting out tangled thoughts.

“According to the records in that tomb, or rather that temple, the Fire God 【Faer】 and the Snow God 【Sinong】 once fought a world-shaking divine war in this land. But… the reason they fought was not hatred.”

“【Sinong】 defeated 【Faer】 in that battle, and through that outcome, the two gods worked together to set up something extremely important. Something that could affect and even change the future of this world. However, the records in the temple never clearly said what that arrangement was, or why it had to be completed through a battle between gods, even leading to their fall…”

“And most importantly, where did the winner of that battle, the Snow God Sinong, go afterward?”

“I’ve been thinking about this question for a long time, and only now do I feel that I’ve finally found some real clues.”

As she spoke, Violet reached into empty space and took out another ice crystal. This one was much smaller, about the size of half a girl’s fist, and was tightly sealed with golden glowing patterns and chains. She placed it next to the much larger extreme-ice crystal for comparison.

“Look. Other than the size and shape, don’t they look almost exactly the same?”

“Oh! Ee-hee~!”

Before the Dragon God could answer, a small bald head suddenly popped out from the priestess’s arms. It jumped onto Violet’s shoulder and happily waved its little hands at the dragon girl, as if proudly showing off something.

Seeing Dumb-dumb act so smug, Xiao Guang snorted, but she didn’t waste time arguing. Instead, she carefully examined the two ice crystals and soon nodded.

“They really are very similar. It’s almost like… they were split from the same whole. But Master, what does this mean?”

“Hehe. True divine power is a god’s most precious lifeline. If a god gives away even a little, they lose that much themselves. They would never hand it over so easily.”

Violet tapped the palm-sized ice crystal in her hand and smiled.

“This crystal was taken by Dumb-dumb from a secret area under the Snowfall Hall, protected by the Eternal Winter Temple. It’s not very large, but it clearly contains true divine power. And now, we’ve found something very similar beneath the main fortress of Ice Lotus Castle. Do you really think that’s just a coincidence?”

“Or rather, besides these two, could there be more, even larger ones, buried deep underground in places no one knows about?”

“The only difference between Ice Lotus Castle and those unknown places is that… what’s buried here happened to come back into the light, by chance.”

“Uh…”

The dragon girl nodded as if she half understood, then quickly realized something.

“Wait, Master. You’ve said all this, but you still haven’t explained where that broken finger came from. So what exactly is it?”

The priestess turned her head and looked at her dragon with a helpless expression.

“Don’t you get it yet, silly? The Snow God and the Fire God had a deep, unknown connection. They worked together and left behind a hidden plan in an extreme way. And these ice crystals contain a huge amount of divine power, equal to Sinong’s own essence. From this, we can reasonably guess that this is very likely the real reason the Snow God disappeared.”

“If that’s the case, then something so tightly wrapped in, or rather merged with the power of the Snow God, this burning, unextinguished flame… what do you think it is?”

“This finger is a god’s remains.”
