Chapter 274: A Cursed Gift

“...Miss Sasha?”

Seeing the girl’s expression change again and again while her eyes stayed fixed on the golden mark on the back of her hand, Valentia watched with worry for a long time. In the end, she could not help but gently poke Sasha’s arm.

“Are you okay? You look completely absent-minded… So what exactly happened back then? Did you really take that thing’s 【Forbidden】 authority?”

As if the topic had finally reached something she cared about, the vampire girl’s cute face instantly lit up with excitement. She even forgot to act calm or elegant, waving her small fists again and again in excitement.

“Doesn’t that mean you’re super strong now?! And what is this mark, anyway? Can you show us a little? I’m really curious!”

“...?”

Interrupted like this by Valentia, Miss Sasha, who had been deeply immersed in the shock of facing death and in the overwhelming power of a goddess who seemed truly all-knowing and all-powerful, finally managed to come back to her senses.

She looked at the vampire girl, whose behavior was now completely different from her first impression. After surviving life and death together, their relationship had grown closer, and Valentia seemed to be showing more of her true self. Then Sasha lowered her gaze to the golden symbol on the back of her hand, whose light was finally starting to fade, yet was still bright and shining…

Thinking of all the unbelievable things she had just experienced, mixed emotions filled her heart. For a moment, she truly did not know how to explain it.

“Actually…”

She glanced at the Snow Girl beside her, someone who had temporarily gone from enemy to ally, but whose true identity was still unclear. Sasha opened her mouth, about to say something, but—

At that moment, the ground beneath their feet suddenly began to shake violently!

“Rumble—rumble—rumble!!!!!”

The shaking seemed to come from the very foundation of the world itself. Each wave was stronger than the last, as if some terrifying existence buried deep beneath the frozen land was moving again and again, about to break through the ice and return to this world!

“Wah! What now?! Are you kidding me, does this never end?!”

Unable to use their powers here, the three girls were thrown off balance by the intense shaking. They swayed left and right like they were drunk, nearly falling to the ground. Sasha herself was completely confused by this sudden earthquake, but it was clear that both Valentia and the mysterious, pure Snow Girl seemed to know something about what was happening.

“Why is this happening? Didn’t we already drive that thing away?!”

If Valentia’s face showed shock and confusion, then the Snow Girl, who likely understood this so-called 【Forbidden Domain】 much better, looked completely serious. The small excitement from the merchant girl’s miraculous success had vanished without a trace.

She stabbed her beautiful, sharp longsword into the ice to keep her balance. After hesitating for a moment, she finally spoke again in a solemn voice.

“Didn’t you already see the message on the ice monument? One thousand years… That was the final limit of the seal left back then. They were supposed to wake up a thousand years ago. It was only because two great gods used extremely drastic methods to create this frozen world that the moment was delayed!”

“Even without the black flames, the final time point was already very close. Its sudden appearance only sped things up, making an already unstable situation even more chaotic and dangerous!”

“Hey, hey! You two are doing it again, aren’t you?! Can you two say something I can actually understand?!”

The three girls argued loudly, like ants trapped on a hot pan. No matter how anxious they were, they could not change the situation at all, nor did they have the power to affect it.

Although Sasha had fused with, and even gained control over, a small part of the 【Forbidden】 authority, her mortal nature could not bear it. Most of it had now been sealed into the 【Forbidden Word】 left by the goddess. Unless it was a desperate, life-or-death moment, she could not use it freely.

Trying to stop a massive upheaval of the land, one that might be spreading across the entire world, with the little power she had was nothing but a foolish dream.

And so, amid the three girls’ very different reactions, the true source of the earth-shaking disturbance… appeared.

“Crack… crack… crack-crack-crack-crack-crack…!”

The frozen ground began to split at a speed visible to the naked eye. Just like the bare land they had once seen near the ice monument, where pure ice lotuses had grown, large areas of similar land were now being exposed as the ice layer shattered piece by piece.

This time, however, the invisible rules that had once stopped the black flame from burning the ice did not appear. It was as if those rules had suddenly vanished, allowing everything to move forward at an alarming speed.

Until—

“Boom!!!!!!!”

A massive object smashed through the heavily cracked ice, rising from the ground like a mountain. Amid violent shaking of the earth, it surged upward toward the sky!

It was… a castle, far larger than anything seen in the outside world!

Calling it a castle was not fully accurate. It looked more like a strange and towering spire.

The entire structure was built from an unknown material that looked like extreme ice. It had no outer walls or covering. Even though Sasha and the others were still very far away, they could clearly see its strange and grand shape, like countless circular layers stacked together, spiraling upward.

It looked like floating towers piled one on top of another, growing narrower as they rose higher. Yet even the single dream-like palace at the very top, carved from ice like jade, seemed to be at least hundreds of meters wide.

Such a creation could never exist in the mortal world.

Only the hand of a god from legend could build an ice tower taller than mountains and place such a magnificent palace on top, for all beings to worship.

“Oh my god—! Uh… no, wait… what in the world is that?!”

Clearly, even though Miss Sasha had gained part of the 【Forbidden】 authority and now possessed traits that even gods might not reach, her very human habit of overreacting had not changed at all.

Standing on the ice, where cracks could still be faintly seen, she stared wide-eyed at the ice tower reaching into the sky. Every movement showed how stunned and inexperienced she looked, and she almost blurted out exactly what was on her mind.

In this regard, the other two women, who were truly high-ranking figures, were much calmer and more composed than the merchant girl.

Well… that might also be because they already knew some “inside information.”

“So it really exists…”

“…Yes.”

Responding to Valentia’s quiet murmur, the Snow Girl gazed silently at the distant, magnificent ice tower, as if she had known about it all along. In a soft voice, she revealed its long-hidden true identity.

“Snow God Castle… the divine residence said to have risen from the ground in a single night by the supreme power of the Ice and Snow God, Sinong. It was once the highest holy land in the hearts of countless believers. I never thought we would see it like this.”

“The situation has completely gone beyond the original plan. I wonder if this should be called luck… or misfortune…”

“Hey, so you two are just ignoring what I said, right…?”

Listening to their riddle-like conversation, Miss Sasha, still stuck in the feeling of “Why does it seem like I’m the only one who doesn’t understand anything?”, could not help rolling her eyes.

But after spending so much time in the snow lands, she had heard many stories about the one supreme god of this region, the Ice and Snow God Sinong. Those stories did include the name the two of them had just mentioned.

Snow God Castle, the divine realm where the Ice and Snow God and his followers and children once lived, was seen in the age of myths as the symbol of Sinong Themself. Countless believers had gathered around the castle, building homes nearby and worshiping the god day and night. It was once the unquestioned center of civilization in the entire northern world, forming an unmatched and enormous settlement.

It was said that at its peak, its scale far surpassed even today’s largest fortress in the snow lands, the capital of the Snow Empire.

Yet this castle, which carried so much of the northern world’s history, vanished strangely a thousand years ago, along with the disappearance of the Snow God Sinong.

For some unknown reason, this extremely important part of history is strangely unclear and vague in all known records.

Why did Snow God Castle disappear?

Where is the land where it once stood now?

Where did the countless people who once lived there go?

All information related to these questions is strangely unknown. Some locals even treat it as a ghost story.

Some say that the present-day ‘Endless Ice Field’ is actually the original form of the snow lands. If so, the former home of the Snow God might still stand deep inside that frozen land, which is now a 【Forbidden Domain】 of civilization, this is why no one has ever found it.

Others believe that after the Snow God Sinong disappeared, Snow God Castle was destroyed in unknown conflicts among the divine children, buried in endless wars and lost forever.

Rumors, guesses, and unclear stories led to countless theories. Sasha did not care much about which one was true, but just from hearsay alone, she had already heard more than a dozen versions.

“Alright, alright… so why is the legendary Snow God Castle appearing here, and why did it come out of the ground? More importantly, what exactly is this place?”

After going in a big circle, the topic finally returned to the starting point. This time, Valentia no longer tried to act mysterious. She sighed and explained,

“When we first arrived, I saw an ice monument with records written in 【Ancient Niel language】. It said that to stop some terrifying things beneath the northern world from awakening, the Snow God used Their own Temple, Snow God Castle, as the center of an incredibly large divine formation, one that covered nearly half the world.”

“That formation was created from the god’s Divine Realm, and what we now call the Extreme Cold Zone is actually the outer boundary of this world-scale formation.”

“Because Snow God Castle had gathered immense faith power over countless years, it had already become Sinong’s strongest and most special divine artifact. So the god used Their great power to drive it deep into the ground like a giant nail, making it the key pillar that sealed those things below.”

“Centered on it, the Snow God’s Divine Realm merged with the divine formation, becoming a special world. Separate, yet existing alongside the northern world in an unseen way. It forcibly froze everything that should have awakened. Ordinary people cannot touch this space, but… it still has special links to the real world.”

Seeing that this explanation might be too hard to follow, and noticing Sasha scratching her head already, the Snow Girl, who clearly understood this land much better, added casually,

“You can think of the 【Forbidden Domain】 as a shadow of the real world, or a reverse side, or an ‘underground’ world. This reverse side is not just a physical space. Lord Sinong did not create the 【Forbidden Domain】. What They did was merge Their Divine Realm with it and use Their supreme power to completely freeze it, to delay certain events that were bound to happen.”

“This ‘reverse world’ cannot directly touch our real world, but there are still anchor points that connect the two. Snow God Castle is like a huge pillar that passes through both worlds at the same time. It is the main anchor, and besides it, there are other smaller points used to support the divine formation.”

“These points are usually hidden very deep underground, far beyond the reach of mortals, but that is not absolute.”

“Sometimes, the divine formation can develop unexpected errors. These can cause anchor points to shift, or allow the Snow God’s power inside the 【Forbidden Domain】 to leak out, creating phenomena that should not exist in the real world.”

“…?”

Looking at the deep meaning hidden in the Snow Girl’s icy blue eyes, Sasha realized it immediately. If she still could not understand at this point, she would not deserve her years as a traveling merchant.

“Oh, so there’s one of these abnormal anchor points beneath Ice Lotus Fortress, and that’s exactly why Ice Lotuses can grow there. I’m not wrong, right?”

The Snow Girl did not answer directly. She only snorted with clear contempt.

“Hah. How ridiculous, those short-sighted fools actually think this is some divine treasure or blessing left behind by a god. They try every way to use this leaking Snow God power for profit, even guiding it to leak faster, all to grow some so-called ice lotuses…?”

“These idiots have no idea what will truly pour out from this crack! Every bit of benefit they squeeze from that divine power will be repaid many times over in the near future. Ice Lotus Fortress, its people, and the entire northern world will pay a terrible price!”

“What will destroy everything is not the Northern Calamity, nor the Ice Tide. It is this laughable and ugly thing called greed!”
