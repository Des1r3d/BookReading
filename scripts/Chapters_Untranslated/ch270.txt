Chapter 270: To Wear the Crown, One Must Bear Its Weight

Seeing the very recognizable features under the other woman’s hood, still clearly visible even while moving at such high speed, Valentia’s brow visibly furrowed.

“...A Pure Snow Girl?”

Sasha might not have a high enough status to know about beings on this level, but Valentia, as a vampire grand duke and the representative of this visiting delegation, had long studied the Snow Empire in detail, especially information about its ruling class.

The Pure Snow Girls were extremely rare and noble beings, even among the Snowfolk themselves.

The snow people held a high position in the northern world because they carried a trace of the true divine blood left behind by Sinong, the God of Ice and Snow. Even though this bloodline was not direct and had been passed down and diluted over countless generations, it still gave the Snowfolk talent and power far beyond that of ordinary races.

That was the nature of gods, vast and mighty. Even having the slightest connection to them was enough to benefit ordinary people for a lifetime, and even their descendants.

A Pure Snow Girl was someone who had awakened that thin divine blood within her and fully brought out its power.

This phenomenon was often called “returning to the ancestor.” Long ago, the first Holt Maiden of Eternal Winter, who founded the Eternal Winter Temple, was the first Pure Snow Girl in history.

As a true child of the Ice and Snow God Sinong, if the Eternal Winter Holy Maiden could be seen as a race of her own, then Pure Snow Girls, those who awakened the divine blood, could be considered her people. Roughly speaking, that was the relationship.

Under normal circumstances, in the current age, there were only two ways a Pure Snow Girl could appear.

The first was natural awakening. Any Snowfolk with divine blood had a small chance that a child would awaken the bloodline at birth, much like a 【God&apos;s Favored】. In essence, it was a random gift from heaven.

But the problem was that this chance was unbelievably small.

Even within the Snow Empire’s royal family, where divine blood was the most pure and concentrated, the chance of a newborn awakening the bloodline was less than one percent. Among ordinary Snowfolk, the chance dropped to one in several thousand, or even tens of thousands.

On top of that, Pure Snow Girls were pure spirits of ice and snow, kin of the Eternal Winter Holy Maiden, and could only appear among females. This made the already tiny chance even smaller.

There were no exact numbers or complete population records, but in the entire northern world, the total number of pure-blood Snowfolk likely did not exceed ten thousand. From that alone, one could imagine just how rare a Pure Snow Girl truly was.

As far as Valentia knew, at least according to the Snow Empire’s records, there had been no naturally born Pure Snow Girl in its territory, including the royal family, for at least fifty years.

The only known recent one appeared through the second special method. After successfully resonating with the divine artifact Ice and Snow God Seal, she received its blessing and was transformed later in life. This was the current and only candidate for Holy Maiden within the Eternal Winter Temple, Lady Moraya Sinong, who was said to soon inherit the position of High Priestess.

The most distinctive features of a Pure Snow Girl were the six solid, ribbon-like streamers formed from bloodline power behind her back, and the ice-and-snow symbol in her eyes that showed her divine blood had awakened. The former might be hidden by a cloak, but the divine mark in her eyes was impossible to conceal, and it looked almost exactly the same as the illustrations Valentia had once seen.

No wonder this woman possessed such terrifying power…

But where did a Pure Snow Girl suddenly come from?

Every Pure Snow Girl in history was almost always clearly recorded. Even though they had extremely long lifespans, the number of those who might still be alive today would not exceed one hand.

So who was she?

And more importantly, how could a noble and respected Pure Snow Girl do something as horrifying as leading assassins to attack Ice Lotus Castle, and mercilessly slaughter every living being she encountered?

Valentia stared for a moment at that unfamiliar yet clearly extraordinary beautiful face, frowning slightly. Noticing her strange gaze, the mysterious woman, who had taken off her hood on her own, seemed to have expected this. She calmly accepted the looks filled with doubt and barely hidden shock, her expression steady.

Fortunately, the vampire girl had an excellent sense of priorities and social judgment. No matter how unbelievable this was, she still suppressed the turmoil in her heart and chose to maintain this fragile temporary alliance for now.

“Sigh… Let’s think about that later, after we get out of danger. You mentioned earlier that there’s a way to counter that thing behind us through Miss Sasha. What exactly is it?”

Seeing how well Valentia kept her emotions in check and focused on the bigger picture, the mysterious woman, likely a Pure Snow Girl, showed a hint of appreciation and a faint smile before speaking openly.

“Just as I said before, the reason They can force Their way into this land ruled by strict laws and use power that is not allowed is because by swallowing and merging with the 【Forbidden】, They has gained a certain level of 【Forbidden authority】 that goes beyond the rules. If we want to fight back, we can only start from that point.”

She turned her head toward Sasha, who wore a troubled expression, as if already sensing future trouble.

“Although I still don’t fully understand the reason, this girl is without doubt a true 【Apostle of the Forbidden】. In this aspect, even They cannot be compared to her. From what we’ve seen so far, her compatibility with the 【Forbidden】 and her ability to control it are far greater than his forced fusion. This is our only chance to win.”

Even though Valentia had already guessed that the method would not be simple, hearing it spoken out loud still made her sharply inhale, her pupils shrinking.

“You don’t mean to…?”

“Yes!”

The mysterious woman answered loudly. Her majestic and beautiful face shone with confidence and determination.

“By using her higher authority over the 【Forbidden】, we take, absorb, and seize that unspeakable power beyond the rules that They now holds. If we succeed, even They will once again be suppressed by the laws of the 【Forbidden Domain】. We could even use the 【Forbidden】 in reverse to restore our original power within this divine land. As Their strength falls and ours rises, we will have a real chance to defeat Them!”

“No, no! That’s far too reckless!” Valentia’s brows visibly knitted as she shook her head again and again.

“Putting aside the fact that Miss Sasha is just an ordinary person and we don’t even know how much she can truly interfere with the 【Forbidden】. Even if it somehow works, have you thought about the terrible consequences of bringing the ‘unspeakable forbidden thing’ into her body?!”

“I know it’s extremely dangerous, but this is the only option we have!” the woman shot back. “Is continuing to run away like this, until we are all swallowed by Them, really better than taking one desperate fight?!”

“Even so—!”

“Uh, um… sorry to interrupt…”

At that moment, the person at the center of the discussion weakly raised her hand and carefully spoke up to the two powerful women who were arguing fiercely.

“I don’t really want to interrupt, but… that thing seems to have suddenly gotten faster. If we keep talking, I think we’re really going to die…”

“?!”

Valentia and the mysterious woman were both startled and quickly turned to look behind them.

Just as Sasha said, at some unknown moment, the black flames that had been chasing them nonstop seemed to gain some kind of boost. Their already terrifying speed increased again. Even though the girls were sliding at full speed in these completely undignified, awkward poses, the distance between them was visibly shrinking!

If this continued, they would be caught in at most a few dozen seconds.

The two women exchanged a glance, and almost instantly, they both understood why this had happened.

Because of the strong wind caused by their high-speed sliding, they couldn’t speak calmly like usual and had to shout to be heard. And the black flames were not far behind them. If, as the mysterious woman said, the enemy was a self-aware being of a very high level, then it was entirely possible that it had overheard their conversation.

Yes. There was no doubt about it…

It had heard them. It had even understood that the plan the mysterious woman spoke of could truly threaten it. That was why it suddenly increased its speed, trying to end the chase before they could put the plan into action.

“Still hesitating?! A beautiful future without risk or sacrifice exists only in dreams! We have to act, now!!!”

“……”

Hearing the mysterious woman’s voice rise sharply, almost turning into a roar, Valentia clenched her teeth and once again looked toward the one who now carried everyone’s hopes. The ordinary girl who had once seemed like nothing more than an unlucky bystander, but had now become the key to success or failure.

But Sasha simply smiled and gave the vampire girl a thumbs-up with one hand.

“Exactly. If we’re going to die anyway, we might as well go all out! Leave it to me!”

“Scrreee—!!!”

The moment her words ended, the brown-haired girl suddenly pushed hard with her feet. Her shoes scraped loudly against the smooth ice, and her body came to a sharp stop at a visible speed.

She turned around directly and stared fiercely at the black wave of flames that, because one target had stopped, was now roaring toward her with terrifying force, already right in front of her in the blink of an eye.

“Miss Sasha?!”

Valentia’s shocked cry came from behind, but the girl did not turn around, nor did she have time to answer.

She did not ask the mysterious woman how to use the authority of the 【Forbidden】 or how to take those strange powers from the enemy, because Sasha knew very clearly.

Only she herself could find that answer.

Success… or death.

The flames rushed toward her face, yet she felt no heat at all. Instead, a deep, bone-chilling cold invaded her, seeping into her bones and soul, making her body tremble without control.

In that moment, through the dark flames, she seemed to see a pair of eyes hidden deep in the shadows, and their gazes quietly met.

They were empty, cold eyes, like those of a top predator in the law of the jungle. The roaring black fire looked as if it could swallow everything in the world. She saw burning ice plains, and beneath layers of ice, countless strange, twisted figures that had been set alight.

The black flames were burning, devouring, and merging with those figures. Yet at the same time, they were also being changed and twisted in return, because what was being consumed was not just individuals or beings, but something larger and shapeless as a whole.

That unspeakable, unnameable thing that surrounded everything and formed its very nature was exactly like the characters once shown to Sasha, drawn and recorded by 【Flame】.

At that instant, a sudden and powerful understanding bloomed in the girl’s mind.

Yes… this was the 【Forbidden】.

It was not a single power, nor a single law. It was a massive, complex cluster of something much greater.

Countless individuals, symbols, perhaps even a nation or an entire world.

Everything connected to it was covered by an invisible, unspeakable giant net woven from something called 【Forbidden】.

That net soaked into their roots and essence, locked them in chains, and hid their traces. They clearly existed, yet anything outside that net, outside the 【Forbidden】, could not understand their concept at all. Even touching it by accident would bring instant backlash.

But it still existed.

“Tff!”

The moment she realized this truth, even with Sasha’s strange and unknown high compatibility with the 【Forbidden】, she could not control it, two streams of black blood poured from her nose.

She was understanding the 【Forbidden】, and in that process, the net called 【Forbidden】 was also invading and erasing every trace of Sasha in return, just like the black flames.

But the girl did not stop.

Not enough. Far from enough…!

Only by understanding the 【Forbidden】 even more deeply, by going beyond the limit of being devoured and merged by the black flames, would she have a chance to take its authority for herself, and fight for that…

tiny, fragile chance to live.
