Chapter 262: Extreme Cold

Inside the underground tunnel.

The two girls were still quietly following behind the main force of the Eternal Winter Temple.

The length of this tunnel was shockingly long. Honestly, so long that it felt strange for no clear reason.

Violet was well traveled and experienced. She had seen underground spaces far larger and more complex than this before. But those places were built deep underground for clear reasons. To serve as hidden bases, storage areas, or to confuse enemies in complicated terrain. Their purpose was obvious at a glance.

But this tunnel was different.

It was completely empty. Along the way, there were not even a single magic lamp or candle. It was pitch-black, forcing everyone to rely on their own methods for light. Its structure was also extremely simple, aside from the two directions at the very start, it was almost just a straight path with no branches at all.

Such a meaningless design felt as if it existed only to waste the travelers’ time. How could that not raise suspicion?

But was it truly meaningless?

The priestess would soon understand the answer with her own eyes.

……………………………………………

“Rumble… rumble rumble rumble…”

At a certain moment, the ground beneath their feet, and the entire tunnel itself, suddenly began to tremble slightly.

“W-what’s going on?”

“No idea. An earthquake?”

“At a time like this… isn’t that a little too convenient?”

The Temple experts who were carefully moving forward naturally noticed the change. They stopped, looking around with confusion and growing tension.

Even the High Priestess, Kellian Sinong, showed a clearly puzzled expression, as if she also could not understand the cause of this sudden disturbance.

But soon, something faster than sound reached them.

“Hiss… is it… just me? Why does it suddenly feel colder around here?”

“Uh… I think I feel it too…”

“No! This isn’t imagination! Hey, there’s frost forming on you!”

Yes.

The temperature of the entire tunnel was dropping at an unbelievable speed.

The air, which had been tolerable because they were indoors, instantly fell below freezing, and it did not stop. It kept plunging downward at a terrifying rate.

In just the blink of an eye, a thin layer of white frost became visible on everyone’s bodies, as well as on the walls and the ground around them.

“This is… wait—!? That’s impossible…”

Seeing this scene, the High Priestess at the front seemed to finally realize something. Her pupils shrank sharply, her face turning pale with shock. She spun around and shouted at the top of her lungs.

“Form seals! Everyone pull in! Prepare to resist the cold wave!!!”

As she spoke, Kellian immediately took out a snow-white square seal, clear like crystal, the symbol of her authority and power, and raised it high. She poured magic into it without restraint, causing the entire seal to burst into dazzling, blinding light!

“Y-Yes!!”

Although many were still confused and did not understand what was happening, the rapidly falling temperature, so cold that even people who had lived in the northern lands for years were struggling to endure it, left no room for doubt.

With the High Priestess leading them, all the Temple experts moved at once, acting quickly and efficiently.

The executors responsible for protection and close combat moved quickly. In the narrow tunnel, they formed the tightest square formation possible, weapons pointed outward, ready for battle.

Those hidden within the group, the 【Seal Wielders】 and 【Holy Seal Wielder】 who wielded power granted by the Snow God, followed Kellian. One after another, they brought out their divine seals and pushed them to their limits.

“Snow God, protect us!!!”

Everyone shouted together. From each seal burst bright blue-white light, gathering above their heads into one. It then poured down, forming a solid, heavy barrier that completely covered everyone, thick and sealed like a massive layer of ice.

Almost at the exact moment their emergency defense was completed, the source of the roaring sound and shaking came rushing out from the dark depths of the tunnel.

“BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!!!!”

It was as if the end of the tunnel had been connected to the legendary far-north ice plains, or even to the center of an even colder Extreme Cold Zone. The screaming wave that surged toward them was not just air, wind, a storm, or any natural weather.

It was—

The concept of 【Extreme Cold】 itself, given physical form and turned into a raging, destructive tide.

That was the 【Frostflow】!

It had no physical shape. Yet before the 【Frostflow】 even arrived, the absolute zero that came ahead of it was already close to freezing the space itself.

The thick granite walls of the tunnel cracked open with sharp crack sounds. Frost spread across them at a visible speed. In the air, icy mist glittering with deadly cold light began to form. Everything seemed to be freezing rapidly, and that, of course, included the many Temple elites inside the tunnel.

“Hold the line!!!”

Even the High Priestess, who was usually calm and distant, could barely maintain her composure in the face of such destructive terror. Her shout was almost drowned out by the deafening roar of the freezing tide. Yet the crystal-clear square seal in her hand, the symbol of the Snow God’s blessing and authority, was shining brighter than ever before.

“Hmmm~!”

Like a single lonely lamp in endless snow and wind, all the 【Seal Wielders】 and 【Holy Seal Wielder】, who clearly felt how terrifying the incoming power was, pushed themselves to the limit. They poured every last bit of their magic into the combined barrier above them.

Even the six slightly unreal ribbons floating behind the snow girl became fully solid as she went all out. They stretched forward like six long arms, pressing tightly against the front of the barrier. With countless layers of support added, the ice-like shield shone brightly, struggling to stand firm against the destructive flood.

However—

“BOOM!!!!!!!!”

The instant the invisible 【Frostflow】 itself finally struck the barrier, every figure inside shook violently, unable to control their bodies, as a brutal explosion echoed through the tunnel.

They couldn’t stop it! It was simply… impossible to stop!

The huge gap in power became painfully clear. In many people’s eyes, despair rose uncontrollably.

Right now, they were like a weak, temporary dam made of sand and mud, thrown together in a hurry to face a massive flood. Trying to block the force of nature, or even the vast, violent power of the world itself, with human strength… even ten times their numbers would not change the outcome.

At the very first contact, the barrier built from the combined power of all the priests was instantly covered in terrifying, spider-web-like cracks. This was not just a simple impact. They could clearly feel their magic, everything they were outputting, freezing rapidly within that horrific cold flow.

Even the ice barrier itself was freezing.

An ice wall made of frost magic, ice itself, was being frozen again?!

What kind of unspeakable, terrifying power were they facing… and trying to block?!
