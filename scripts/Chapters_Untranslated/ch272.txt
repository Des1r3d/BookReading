Chapter 272: The Meaning of Sacrifice

Just as the girl understood this price and the unavoidable ending, the hollow voice, silent for a long time, as if it had vanished, finally spoke again.

【Do you… regret it?】

“...?”

Everything in front of her suddenly became clear.

After absorbing a great amount of the 【Forbidden】 authority, Sasha’s consciousness had fully broken through, reaching a level that was hard to describe, far beyond the limits of race and physical form.

Like firewood burning at its peak, releasing a brief but brilliant light, the girl at this moment had even stepped onto the same level as the being before her. Because of this, she could finally see the true source of the cold, empty gaze beneath the black flames.

It was not some strange horror, nor an ugly monster like the one she once saw in the Guru’s bar. The vague figure before her was actually a small girl, just over one meter tall, looking only thirteen or fourteen years old.

She had long hair that burned quietly like black flames, and she wore only a thin, worn-out robe that looked poor and tattered. Judging by her appearance alone, Sasha would never have linked her to such a terrifying identity. She could easily be mistaken for a pitiful child fleeing from disaster.

But she was absolutely not such a being.

Not only because of her pale, almost unreal, smooth and colorless skin, nor because of the raging black flames burning behind her like a backdrop. What truly caught Sasha’s attention were the girl’s eyes.

There were no whites and no pupils. Only pure darkness, like a deep abyss that swallowed all light. 【Divinity】 and 【Forbidden】 mixed chaotically within those eyes, then fused together into endless, burning black flames.

In a normal state, just making eye contact with those eyes would have been enough for the fire, able to swallow all concepts and forms, to rush forward along the chain of cause and effect, burning everything Sasha was into nothing in an instant.

This was a being that could truly be called a 【God】, yet was not a 【God】 at all.

As if sensing the girl’s gaze, the black-flame-born child took a step forward. Her originally unreal figure instantly became clear and solid, appearing fully before Sasha.

In the empty, silent 【Forbidden Domain】, where time itself seemed to no longer exist, the girl, who was neither god nor human, neither life nor existence, stood silently at the other side and faced Sasha.

【Do you… regret it?】

Once again, she asked the same question, without adding even a single extra word.

Seemingly unused to face-to-face conversation, the girl’s voice remained hollow and cold, with noticeable pauses, not like a living being but more like a machine-driven imperial golem. But—

Sasha noticed it.

Beneath that empty shell, there were ripples of something that should not exist there, something called “emotion”.

Curiosity. Confusion. Expectation.

A desire to know overcame pure instinct, creating a strange space for dialogue between two sides that should have been fighting to the death.

It sounded contradictory, but that was the truth.

Suddenly, an unbelievable thought surged through the girl’s mind, making her eyes widen.

“Wait… you, was this all you wanted?!”

At that moment, all doubts and confusion finally found their answer.

It was not that the being lacked the power to fight for the 【Forbidden】 authority, nor was it mocking a mortal’s desperate resistance. The reason it willingly gave up its power was because only this way could Sasha stand on an equal level and truly talk to 【Her】 after merging with the 【Forbidden】.

By allowing her actions, letting the girl achieve her goal smoothly, and letting her naturally understand the meaning behind everything after gaining the 【Forbidden】 authority, it could finally ask that question.

Yes. Everything She had done until now was only to see what kind of answer a mortal girl would give when facing an ending where she would surely disappear, where everything she gave would vanish, and no one would even remember her sacrifice.

Nothing more than that.

But this was not the cruel amusement of a superior being mocking a mortal. The reason She was willing to try this, even at such a cost, was the curiosity of Her, the girl who looked cold and empty, toward something unknown.

Sasha could read this from those black eyes. It was an unbelievable truth that only she, at this very moment, after betting everything and 【resonating】 with the other side, could faintly understand.

【So… do you regret it?】

For the third time, the girl asked the same flat, repeated question.

Whether Sasha felt surprised or confused seemed to have no effect on her at all. Rather than a real conversation, it felt more like both of them were talking to themselves. Perhaps from the beginning, the other side had never truly seen her as an equal, but only as a tool to seek answers and run an experiment.

Or maybe… she simply didn’t know how to talk to people properly?

For some reason, this strange and absurd thought suddenly appeared in a corner of Sasha’s mind.

At this point, her heart had actually become calm.

The anger and reckless courage slowly faded away. The hatred and rage she had built up, toward this thing before her, and toward other high-and-mighty beings who could take away the right to live from a tiny mortal like her on a whim, also seemed to disappear when faced with life and death.

Sasha felt like she had become a wise person.

So, facing the girl’s deep, black, and strangely pure gaze, she only gave a helpless smile.

“If you ask whether I feel unwilling… yeah, a little. I haven’t lived long enough yet, and there are still many things I want to do…”

“But… I don’t regret it.”

Her calm, natural voice made the endless black flames filling the void suddenly pause for a moment.

Sensing the change and flicker of emotion in those black eyes, Sasha awkwardly scratched her head. Her consciousness now completely separated from her body. Seeing that the other side didn’t speak for a long time, she continued.

“Even if time could go back, I think I’d still make the same choice… probably?”

“Ahahaha… hey, hey, say something.”

【…Why?!】

It seemed this answer mattered a lot to her. The girl’s always-flat voice now carried hints of urgency and frustration. Sasha understood the doubt hidden beneath it, yet felt puzzled herself and simply shook her head.

“There’s nothing strange about it, right? I can’t run away, and I can’t win by fighting. If giving up my life means the three of us don’t all die, that’s better, isn’t it? And it looks like I’m the only one who can do this anyway. There’s no other choice.”

【But no one… will remember you. Other than loss… you gain nothing! Why should a shared crisis be paid for by only one individual!?】

【What you give up is… a price worse than death! And they… are pure beneficiaries! I don’t understand… why, why even so… you… you can walk calmly toward the end?】

【Once existence is lost… nothing remains… you own nothing… cannot protect yourself… everything becomes meaningless!】

“Uh…”

Seeing the girl loudly questioning her, almost like she was desperately declaring her own strict values, Sasha fell silent for a moment.

She didn’t know how to argue back. After all, she wasn’t a philosopher, calling herself a “wise person” was just a joke. She also had no idea how to teach a child. Scratching her head awkwardly, she could only speak honestly from her heart.

“Maybe you’re right… but compared to everyone being destroyed together, if giving up my small life lets the people I care about keep living, then it has value and meaning. If I think it’s worth it, what’s wrong with taking a loss? This kind of chance probably only comes once in a lifetime anyway…”

“Even though I’m a merchant, relationships between people were never meant to be built only on profit. So-called races, so-called civilizations, if everyone treated everything around them with your way of thinking, then this world… would be far too hopeless, wouldn’t it?”

【……】

This time, the other side fell into a long silence.

Finally, the girl spoke again, her voice returning to cold and empty.

【Foolish… mortal.】

“Hey, hey, what’s that supposed to mean? Losing the argument so you start insulting me? Did some mortals steal your rice or something? Do you really need to keep saying that?”

Heh. Miss Sasha was never the kind of person who would just accept a loss quietly. Anyway, things were already this bad. No matter how strong the other side was, they couldn’t make her any worse than this, so why be scared? Just talk back and be done with it!

But it seemed that the earlier question was all the other side wanted to ask. No matter whether the answer pleased her or not, the girl no longer had any intention of paying Sasha any attention.

Her figure slowly faded away and merged into the endlessly burning black flames. The connection between them, formed through 【Forbidden】, began to break. Sasha’s consciousness gradually left that special space, left the state of ascension, or rather… she was “kicked” out.

And this was the girl’s end.

Her consciousness had merged with far too much 【Forbidden】 power. The strange authority she took from the black flames gave Sasha an extremely high level of existence, enough that, in a sense, she could stand on the same level as the black flames themselves. But her body, as a mortal’s body, simply could not hold or carry such a vast state of being.

Sasha understood very clearly now. The so-called 【Forbidden compatibility】 was never, and could never be, carved into a physical body. What truly matched 【Forbidden】 was her essence, her existence itself.

Not to mention that her broken body was already close to collapse under the erosion of 【Forbidden】, with its basic functions almost stopped. Even if she were given a brand-new, healthy body, the result would be the same as long as her consciousness, carrying 【Forbidden】, returned to it.

A small, old wooden boat can never carry a giant dragon.

The girl called Sasha had already completely merged with 【Forbidden】. Her very existence had become part of what was “unspeakable and unknowable”.

Perhaps 【Sasha】’s awareness would not vanish completely, but she would never again be able to communicate with or touch anything, any being at all. She wouldn’t even be able to sense the outside world, like a prisoner exiled forever into a barren wasteland, feeling endless loneliness until the moment she finally faded away entirely.

This was exactly what she had seen before. The past of countless others who were also cast into 【Forbidden】, exiled and abandoned.

The stronger the 【Forbidden】 power, the stronger the backlash. To truly hold this cursed power, unless someone could become strong enough to surpass 【Forbidden】 itself and break the rules written into its very root, they would inevitably have to bear this fate.

Sasha didn’t know why the black flames could use this power in the real world, but it was obvious that she could not.

The black flames, the girl, only held a small fragment of the whole 【Forbidden】. And what Sasha took was just a partial piece of that fragment, the part that had descended into this forbidden land.

The gap was far too great. Or rather, the idea itself was a contradiction.

In fact, no one had ever managed to do such a thing. That was why 【Forbidden】 was still 【Forbidden】.

The almost-frozen flow of time began to move again.

As her consciousness returned, supported by a body not yet completely broken, Sasha could barely still see the black flames surging before her. She saw the once-raging fire lose the support of 【Forbidden】, be suppressed again by the returning rules, and finally collapse.

But she could no longer hear.

No sound. No pain. Her body no longer felt like a body. The brief flash of light before her eyes quickly fell into darkness.

As her awareness lost its vessel, it slowly broke apart and faded. She could no longer think, no longer move, like that half-awake, half-asleep haze after a midday nap…

Nothingness.

This was the only thing Sasha could feel, and perhaps, the shackle that would last forever.

“Haha… as expected, I still feel a bit unwilling.”

Her blurry awareness trembled slightly, like a drowning person’s last instinctive struggle, then quickly sank back into silence, not even causing the smallest ripple in the nothingness.

No one could save her, because 【Forbidden】 was an absolute foundation carved into the very bottom of the world, the root outline of all things. Even gods and laws stood beneath it.

…Really?

Then, after who knows how long, or perhaps only the next instant. Sasha, deep in the void, suddenly heard it.

A girl’s clear, bell-like laugh.

It was as if someone was speaking softly by her ear. Or perhaps her freed consciousness had broken its chains, followed a strange and dreamlike line of cause and effect, and glimpsed a ripple that did not belong to mortals at all.

It… no, 【She】 said…

【Oh my, look what we’ve found~?】
