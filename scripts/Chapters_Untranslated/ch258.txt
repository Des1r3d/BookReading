Chapter 258: The Muddy Waters Grow Even Murkier

Compared to the side that was attacked, the number of dead masked killers was much smaller, less than one tenth of the victims. Even though they were comrades, it seemed no one had tried to collect their bodies. The dead were simply left lying flat on the ground together with everyone else, which made the scene look especially bleak.

Kellian looked around several times, but still did not see the main force of the attackers. She raised her hand and gave a signal. The strong members of the Temple behind her immediately understood and spread out, moving quickly across the field of corpses to search for any survivors, even though the chances were very low.

“This is just insane… What are these people really trying to do? Acting so openly and without fear, are they really not afraid of the Snow Empire taking revenge?”

Hearing a high-ranking priest beside her mutter in disbelief, Kellian turned to glance at his pale face and simply shook her head.

“If your goal is to completely destroy an organization, would you still worry about revenge after the fact while carrying out your plan?”

After saying this, and without waiting for the shocked reactions of those around her, the High Priestess of the Temple stepped over the bodies on the floor and walked straight toward a certain spot.

The guards and subordinates looked at one another, then hurried to follow her.

Kellian did not pay attention to how her subordinates moved. As she walked, she kept carefully observing the entire battlefield. As a veteran with rich experience, she quickly noticed many details and clues.

The reason she believed a fierce battle had taken place here, rather than a one-sided massacre, was not only because a few killer corpses could be seen, but also because of the wounds on the castle guards, servants, and even the guests.

On her way here, although she had been extremely anxious, the priestess had not lost her calm. Even while running at full speed, she had still paid attention to her surroundings and habitually observed the condition of the bodies.

In fact, aside from the soldiers who had been frozen to death, most of the ordinary people who fell to blades outside had been killed with a single clean cut to the throat or beheading. The strikes were fast and ruthless, showing that the attackers did not torture their targets. They were disciplined and precise.

But inside this banquet hall, although some people had died in similar ways, many more clearly had wounds on other parts of their bodies. Some had even been hacked by many blades, a sign that usually only appears in chaotic close combat or group attacks.

This showed that the killers had met strong resistance and could no longer kill as easily as before. Another important point was that the freezing power that had once wiped out many castle guards did not seem to have appeared in this hall. That was also one of the key reasons the battle had turned into a stalemate.

While analyzing the information left behind on the battlefield, Kellian continued forward with her group and finally reached the area near the main stage of the banquet hall. There, she saw that tables and chairs had been piled together to form a simple defensive position.

Not only that, but there were clearly more dead killers in this area. All of this suggested that this was likely the core zone where the fighting had been most intense.

Suddenly, the priestess’s eyes moved slightly. She quickly crouched down and reached out to examine the body of a killer at her feet. The corpse had been dead for a long time and looked unusually shriveled and thin.

“This is…”

Another top-level officer, whose strength was second only to hers, also crouched down and checked the body for a moment. He then showed a look of surprise.

“All the blood in this man’s body was drained completely? What a brutal and cruel method. Could this be some kind of dark magic?”

Kellian clicked her tongue lightly and replied without even lifting her head.

“What kind of bias is this? If you want to say it nicely, you call it defeating the enemy. If you say it bluntly, it is simply killing. Either way, they are just methods of killing enemies. As long as there is no deliberate torture, is there really a ‘higher’ or ‘lower’ way to do it? Does cutting someone down with one strike suddenly count as kind and gentle?”

“Uh…”

Seeing the officer scratch his head in embarrassment, clearly not knowing how to respond, the High Priestess gave a direct answer.

“It was the vampire race, and the level of this blood magic was not low. I roughly know who it was. I heard that for this meeting, the vampire race even sent several members at duke level. No wonder they were able to hold out against the attackers for so long in such a situation. The foundation of an old race is indeed impressive.”

As she spoke, Kellian frowned slightly and quickly looked around.

When she did not find the bodies she had expected to see, she finally let out a breath of relief.

She did not know whether this was also part of the enemy’s plan, but if important members of the vampire race delegation had truly died in this chaos, then with the Snow Empire already facing trouble both inside and outside, it would probably be unable to bear the anger and blame of a former myth-level race.

It seemed that the goals of this operation had just gained another condition.

While silently organizing her thoughts, Kellian did not stay any longer. She went around the simple defensive position made from stacked tables and chairs and came to the back of the banquet hall’s main stage, to a very hidden dead corner below. But the scene in front of her immediately made her heart sink.

The secret passage had really been opened…

About six or seven castle guards were lying in messy positions near the entrance. They clearly had gone through an extremely fierce fight. Their armor had been hacked to pieces, their bodies covered in blood. Right behind where they had fallen, a staircase leading downward had been revealed as the mechanism was activated.

The stairs were also stained with blood from someone unknown, stretching down into a dark depth where nothing could be clearly seen. At this point, if Kellian still could not guess what had happened, then her decades as High Priestess of Ice Lotus Castle would have been for nothing.

Whether there were possible survivors, or the forces represented by those mysterious killers, it seemed they had all entered the depths below through this hidden door. This was truly…

“The worst situation has appeared…”

“High Priest? What do you mean?”

Kellian still did not explain much to her subordinates. Instead, she answered with a question.

“How is the matter I told you before, sending people to contact the external guards and the commander of the city defense forces going?”

“Yes. We arranged it early, as you instructed. At most, in another short while, the main force that received the message should arrive nearby.”

“Mm…”

The priestess nodded expressionlessly and continued to give orders quickly.

“Leave two squads behind to clean up the battlefield and guard this banquet hall. If the main force arrives outside, let them take over the defense after confirming their identity. Try to avoid any conflict with them. Everyone else, stop what you’re doing and follow me down.”

“Today, I want to see for myself who exactly is involved in causing such a shocking disaster. Everyone, prepare for battle!”

“Yes!!!”
