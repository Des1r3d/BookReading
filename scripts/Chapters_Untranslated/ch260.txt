Chapter 260: The Weakest God

Just as Valentia had told Sasha, at the beginning she also thought that the magic pattern hidden in this wall was merely a tool to connect two different spaces, like an anchor for a teleportation circle, or an entrance to the mirror-shadow space that the vampire race is best at using.

But the girl quickly realized that this was not the case.

As the most beloved daughter of Enoch Constantius, the First Prince of the vampire race, Valentia was not allowed to freely leave the Eternal Night City because of her special status. However, aside from that, as long as it was something she wanted, the prince would almost always try his best to satisfy her.

Because of this, many people did not truly understand how astonishing Valentia’s talent and knowledge were. Countless forms of magic and ancient knowledge that the vampire race had passed down since ancient times, things that were considered top secrets to the outside world, including mirror-shadow technology developed using 【Mirror of Reality and Illusion】 as a reference, had already been mastered by the girl over the course of hundreds of years.

She was simply too idle. Spending long, lonely stretches of time shut away in the ancient castle, she had little to do except read to pass the time. That semi-imprisoned life caused Valentia to lose many things in her earlier years, but in return, she was compensated in other ways.

Not only could she learn, she could imitate, improve, and even surpass. With her natural advantages, Valentia Constantius had, without any doubt, become a hidden master of magical theory.

Forget someone like Avrilia, a muscle-brained fool who only knows how to swing an axe. Even Lucine Constantius, the most senior and ancient prince by today’s standards, might not be able to match this seemingly young junior when it came to pure knowledge.

That was why, in a situation like this, Valentia alone was able, and had the chance, to study and analyze the magic pattern on the wall, and attempt something completely beyond what all the planners had expected, something that could utterly change the final outcome.

“I see… If I reverse the flow here and connect it with the other three points…”

Murmuring words no one else could understand, the girl’s fingertips moved across the wall like she was drawing, quickly turning and adjusting.

In the vision that only belonged to Valentia, one that others could not see, the extremely hidden yet very real flow of magic in front of her had already turned into an incredibly complex and profound giant formation. As light flickered, the maze-like lines were corrected and linked together, becoming more complete and more dazzling.

Like picking a lock, what Valentia was doing was, in essence, forcing this formation to start working again through manual methods, even though she did not have the original “key.”

This was without doubt an extremely difficult task, or to be more precise, something that should have been theoretically impossible.

In fact, as the process went on, the vampire girl could clearly feel a terrifying resistance pushing back at her.

This resistance was far greater than she had expected, reaching close to the level of an abstract concept, something invisible and intangible.

That made the girl slowly realize a truth. This incredibly complex and mysterious hidden formation was probably not carved here by Ice Lotus Castle itself, nor by the person who built this secret room.

It was not that the builder of the secret room left a wall here. More likely, it was the exact opposite: because this thing existed first, this room was built around it. The underground tunnel connecting to the outside world existed because of it, and even the entire castle above.

Ice Lotus Castle… may very well have been built here because of it.

This was no exaggeration. The deep and intricate formation possessed power that was truly that astonishing.

It was only the tip of the iceberg of something far greater, something unmatched in scale and grandeur. Yet even this small part now revealed, the meaning and level represented by these lines, was already far beyond the limits of what any mortal mind could understand.

The true 【Divine Skill】!

A faint gold-red light flickered in the girl’s blood-colored eyes. On the surface, it looked like nothing more than simple drawing and painting, occasionally raising her hand to tap the wall once or twice.

But only Valentia herself knew that at this very moment, her mental power was already running close to its absolute limit. Even her forehead was lightly covered with a thin layer of sweat.

As she felt the invisible pressure growing heavier and heavier, what filled her heart was not fear, but quiet relief, mixed with a subtle, helpless sigh.

Ever since that nightmare-like disaster suddenly struck, her original life had been shattered without warning. The truth behind her father’s love, the old memories that had been hidden away, starting from that day, everything that the existence called “Valentia” had believed in for hundreds of years collapsed into nothing. It was the most world-shaking turning point of her life.

But even so, she had to admit that it was not purely a bad thing.

The condition of this body had already been discussed privately and openly with Violet when the “Eternal Night City” incident came to an end. So Valentia clearly understood certain secrets that belonged only to her.

The current Valentia Constantius was, in a certain sense, no longer truly a vampire race member.

Her former body, everything she once was, had already been merged and absorbed by a power equal to true 【Origin Blood】 when the 【God of Origin Blood】 descended. That power’s level was simply too terrifying. Even though its nature was a false reflection created by the 【Mirror of Reality and Illusion】, it still carried an almost irreversible, absolute quality.

Because of this, Valentia could never return to her previous state. Only two very clear paths lay before her…

Either she would be completely crushed into dust by the supreme will behind Origin Blood,

or she would seize this god-like body and attempt to control and command its power.

Valentia, of course, did not want to simply disappear. So she decisively accepted Violet’s suggestion and chose the unquestionable second path.

But controlling the power of a god sounds simple. In reality, the problems involved were countless and far more difficult than imagined.

Not to mention how much energy it would take just to bring a false form that could only exist inside the mirror into the real world. Even if that were somehow achieved, with Valentia’s current soul and mental strength, she would still be completely unable to control such a powerful body.

She was simply too weak, in every sense of the word. Compared to the unspeakable, unknowable existence behind Origin Blood, she did not even have the slightest chance to stand on the same stage. If that will were to awaken again, even a single thought from it would instantly erase Valentia without any suspense.

So for now, she could only rely on the power of others to accomplish this.

It was Violet and the true Vampire Ancestor who worked together to forcibly seal the divinity of the God of Origin Blood deep within this body, compressing it again and again, as much as possible, until the very limit.

In a sense, the person she was now was no longer the Valentia of the past. Instead, she was a being whose body was controlled by Valentia’s consciousness, whose divine power was completely sealed, a god different from the Vampire Ancestor, the God of Origin Blood.
