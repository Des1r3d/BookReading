Chapter 259: A Trapped Beast Still Fights

“Master, now that I think about it… don’t you feel that something is a bit strange?”

In the hidden rear, two girls quietly followed the Temple team as they explored the secret tunnel. Keeping a distance of about ten meters, Xiao Guang seemed to have held back for a long time before finally whispering her doubts in a low voice.

“Oh?”

Unable to perfectly hide her presence like a certain Dragon God, and therefore crouching down and returning to her old sneaky ways while hiding inside a 【Chameleon Cloak】, someone tilted her head and blinked in curiosity.

“What feels strange? Tell me.”

Seeing that this was a serious question from the priestess, the little dragon girl did not hold back. After thinking for a moment, she nodded slightly and spoke.

“First of all, Valentia’s scent is very strong in this tunnel. From the situation, there’s a high chance she already led her people deeper inside. But the problem is, she isn’t a native of this place. How would she know about such a hidden mechanism?”

“If someone inside the castle guided them and opened this escape route for them, then without knowing the internal layout, it would be very unwise for the invaders to chase directly after them.”

“But the smells along the way are extremely mixed. At least hundreds, maybe even more creatures, have passed nearby recently. On top of that, we haven’t seen a single living invader so far. Most likely, the enemy’s main force has already followed Valentia and the others into the depths underground. Do you think there’s any mistake in this judgment?”

The black-haired girl smiled and nodded again.

“That makes sense.”

“…Mm!”

Hearing this, the dragon girl became a little more encouraged. She lowered her voice and continued her analysis.

“It wouldn’t be strange for those people to kill without restraint during the attack, even wiping out every creature they met in the castle. But their goal in coming here definitely wasn’t just killing. If that’s the case, then when the survivors hide in some unknown secret passage, what should the normal response from the other side be?”

Imitating someone’s usual manner, the dragon girl seriously shook her finger.

“As long as they can tell what’s important, the enemy leader would surely choose to abandon those people, or at most leave part of the force behind to guard the exit and seal the tunnel to reduce risks, while leading the main force to complete their real objective. But they didn’t do that. Instead, they moved out in full force and chased all the way in. Isn’t that very strange?”

Listening to her dragon’s clear reasoning, the smile on Violet’s face grew a little deeper.

“It really is very unreasonable. So what do you think the reason might be?”

“Well, um…”

When it came to this part, the dragon girl clearly hesitated for a moment, as if she wasn’t fully sure. But after resting her chin on her hand and thinking briefly, she still tried to guess.

“It’s hard to say for sure… I just feel this behavior doesn’t match normal logic. If I had to guess, maybe Valentia and her group are holding something the enemy really cares about, something they must remove or take at all costs? Or perhaps those people came specifically to assassinate her, to sabotage the alliance plan between the vampire race and this country?”

“Hehe~”

The priestess smiled and shook her head. This time, she did not directly deny or agree with her dragon’s hard-thinking conclusion. She simply turned her gaze back to the front. In her silver-blue eyes, a faint light seemed to flicker.

“No need to rush. We’re actually already very close to the answer, in every sense of the word.”

…………………………

“Hey, um… do you really need to stand that close…?”

Still inside the nearly sealed underground stone room, Miss Sasha looked at the vampire race girl who was pressed right up against the wall, tapping and probing all over it, clearly busy with something unknown. In the end, she couldn’t help but frown and whisper her doubt.

But Valentia was focused on her work. She didn’t even turn her head, still studying the magic pattern lines that couldn’t be seen with the naked eye, and replied calmly.

“Relax. I know a bit about this kind of thing. It won’t cause anything extreme like losing control or exploding. And although the magic power left here is extremely strong, it isn’t very active… just give me a little more time, and I’ll be done soon.”

Hearing this vague answer, Sasha stood alone about one or two meters away from the vampire girl. She looked at the survivors who were busy reinforcing the door, sharpening weapons, or resting and preparing for battle, and could only shake her head with a helpless smile.

“I’m fine with giving you time, but changes in the situation aren’t something we can control. By the way, is it really okay for you to lie to them like this?”

“Lie? I didn’t lie.”

“Oh… huh?!”

The brown-haired girl froze for a moment, then suddenly realized what that meant. She turned her head and stared in shock.

“W-wait, so what you said before…”

Valentia nodded, her expression calm.

“Yes. I already noticed it when we came in earlier. The structure of this underground tunnel is very strange. The lowest level seems to form a large ring. That means even though we temporarily blew up the path, if those assassins choose to go around from the other side and spend more time, they should still be able to reach this room in the end.”

“In fact, I can already sense a large number of strong blood-energy signals rapidly approaching this place. The time we have left is probably not much.”

“Ugh… then the rescue you mentioned earlier…”

“Oh, reinforcements will come, of course. But no one knows exactly when. We can’t put all our hopes on others, can we?”

Valentia answered Sasha slowly, while most of her attention remained on breaking the magic formation in front of her. At the same time, the movements of her hands grew faster and faster.

What she didn’t say was that ever since the assassins suddenly appeared, the direction in which some events were unfolding had quietly made the vampire girl feel uneasy.

First was the maid who claimed to work in the castle and said she had discovered this tunnel by accident.

Her existence… felt far too deliberate.

She was clearly an ordinary person with no combat ability, yet she somehow escaped the enemy’s first wave of slaughter. Then, just when the remaining survivors were pushed into a corner and almost out of options, she appeared at the perfect moment to guide them into this underground passage. And right after completing that task, she was conveniently killed by a stray attack that came from who-knows-where.

It was almost as if this person existed only to lead the remaining survivors into this place. After completing that task, she quietly stepped out of the story, leaving behind no clues to trace at all. Wasn’t that a little too much of a coincidence?

Valentia had a fair amount of confidence in her own abilities, but she also knew very well that if this group of unknown assassins could sneak into the castle without a sound, break through layers of guards, and kill their way into the banquet hall, then their true combat power had to be extremely frightening.

Yet although they did carry out a ruthless slaughter at the very beginning, once Valentia gathered her courage, stepped forward, and led everyone to fight back, the pressure they actually felt from the enemy was not as overwhelming as expected. That was what gave them a brief chance to breathe, and eventually led them to choose to escape into the underground tunnel.

During the heated fighting, Valentia hadn’t thought much about these things. But later, after reaching temporary safety and calming down to think it through, she began to sense that something was off.

When she was with that certain priestess, Valentia had always admired her wild, free-jumping way of thinking. Unrestricted by normal logic, acting freely and naturally. Because of this, Valentia subconsciously started to learn from her, trying to think in the same way, to notice and imagine those strange, seemingly random, even absurd possibilities.

These were assumptions called “possibilities.”

For example, what if that maid never belonged to Ice Lotus Castle at all? What if spies from the assassin organization had already replaced some of the castle’s staff long ago? That could be one of the reasons the lord of the castle was assassinated in public so unexpectedly. And that maid could have been one of them, with everything she did earlier being part of a plan prepared in advance.

Letting go of restrictions, and using this seemingly baseless, purely instinctive guess as a starting point, the vampire girl quickly built a completely different framework for the entire event.

What was the real goal of this attack?

What outcome were those assassins truly trying to achieve?

If their goal was to take or hide something inside the castle, then there was no reason for them to cling so tightly to the survivors. They should have used the time before outside forces reacted to finish something far more important.

But they didn’t do that.

Instead, they chased closely behind, step by step, forcing the survivors to flee deeper and deeper into the tunnel, no matter the cost. If Valentia hadn’t destroyed part of the path back then, what kind of situation would they be facing now?

Yes, the tunnel forms a ring. That means if the enemy attacked from both sides, the survivors would inevitably be trapped at this final dead end, with no way to escape.

It was almost as if the enemy had known all along how this would end.

So was it possible that the enemy’s true target… was actually this place?

And that everything the survivors did from beginning to end was simply guided, or forced, by the invaders?

To be more precise, the assassins may have deliberately hidden their more dangerous methods, controlling the situation. They did not kill everyone outright, but instead left a single path of survival, pushing the remaining people into this place, all the way here. So they could finally carry out what they truly wanted to do.

Carry out… what, exactly?

Looking back over the entire chain of events, Valentia arrived at what seemed to be the most likely answer.

Right in front of her.

That was why she had to uncover the true secret hidden within this wall before the assassins arrived.

Break away from normal thinking. Trust your instincts.

This was what Valentia had learned from that person.

When there is almost no way out, this is the best way to break through the situation.
