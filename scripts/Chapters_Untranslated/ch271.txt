Chapter 271: Self-Immolation

The girl widened her eyes, as if trying to take in all the strange and dangerous secrets hidden beneath the black flames. Yet for some reason, everything in her vision suddenly began to blur.

Only when something warm and wet flowed down her cheeks and soaked into her skin did Sasha realize, a moment too late—

Blood was spilling from her eyes.

Not just a drop or two. More strange, dirty black blood poured out from the corners of her eyes, and from all seven openings of her face. A loud ringing filled her ears, and her violent heartbeat felt like it was about to burst out of her chest, making the world spin wildly around her.

“Cough…!”

She opened her mouth, and a large amount of thick, horrifying black blood surged out of her throat. Strangely, she could not taste the usual metallic smell of blood at all. Instead, it felt like swallowing heavy, dirty mud, making it hard to breathe.

Even so, she did not suffocate, nor did she suffer the usual effects of lack of oxygen. It was not just her sense of taste. One by one, all five senses lost their connection to her mind. Her soul and awareness seemed to slowly break free from her body, rising upward, higher and higher, flying toward a distant emptiness.

Time itself seemed to stretch endlessly in that void.

The burning black flames were clearly right in front of her, yet in Sasha’s blurry yet strangely sharp awareness, the flames, and everything around them, fell into an eerie stillness, as if time had almost stopped. Her consciousness rose into another dimension, entering a “world” that both existed and did not exist, belonging only to the cold eyes beneath the black flames.

She and it were resonating.

Only through resonance, by facing the true it directly, could she possibly defeat it. The chain called 【Forbidden】 connected two beings who should never have met, separated by an unimaginably vast gap. At this very moment…

The divine disaster called 【Flame Calamity】, a godly force meant to bring destruction to all things, stood on one side of the scale.

On the other side stood an ordinary human girl, small and fragile like an ant, living a short and fleeting life.

And because of this, the eyes reflected in the girl’s vision showed something rare and real—

A slight hesitation.

【…Why?】

Sasha heard a low whisper. She could feel the movement coming from the other end of the “rope.”

Confusion. Curiosity. And an open, intense desire to swallow her whole.

But she could not answer.

Relying on her unknown natural compatibility with the 【Forbidden】, her willingness to risk her life, and a bit of luck, the girl had managed to grab one end of the rope in this struggle. But at her core, Sasha was still only a human.

Her soul and origin were far weaker than the being on the other side of the scale. Even if this did not directly decide who would win the struggle, in many other ways, adapting to the environment, controlling power, she was at an absolute disadvantage.

It was like a strong adult wearing thick clothes playing a game in freezing snow with a poorly dressed child. The child might match the adult in skill, or even be slightly better, but her body simply could not endure such harsh conditions.

And right now, Sasha was that child.

“Cough… cough…!”

Black blood continued to pour from all seven openings of her face. While her consciousness was lifted into this special state, as long as the body called “Sasha” still had a trace of life, her actions were not immediately affected. But her life was still truly fading away.

Even though everything was slowed down countless times, the erosion of the 【Forbidden】 was never something that time alone could stop. Its influence kept building up. The moment Sasha fell out of this special state, her fragile human body would collapse completely.

And that—

Would be true death.

The girl clenched her teeth and tightened her grip on the invisible, formless, yet clearly felt rope in her hands.

“Bzz—!!!”

The moment she used her strength for the first time, the space that existed only between her and the awareness beneath the black flames shook violently.

Sasha was suddenly shocked to realize that the mysterious being’s control over the 【Forbidden】 was far weaker than she had ever imagined, far weaker.

With just the first attempt, that unspeakable authority moved a great distance toward her, almost without any resistance at all. The 【Forbidden】 was rapidly merging into her very essence. There was no doubt about it, this was real.

…It couldn’t be only this weak.

Had the other side stopped resisting and simply allowed her to take the power of the 【Forbidden】?

Why?

Then, once again, the girl heard that hollow voice, sounding like a quiet murmur to itself.

【I do not understand… why do mortals choose self-destruction?】

“Cough…!”

As the erosion of the 【Forbidden】 deepened even further, Sasha’s body once again spewed large amounts of black, filthy blood. Even so, she forced her eyes wide open, staring straight at the cold, empty presence beneath the black flames. At last, a hoarse curse, like air being forced from a broken bellows, tore from her throat.

“Damn you! Isn’t it because of you, cough, you bastard forcing me this far?! And now you come out and talk like it’s none of your business?!”

The cold, empty voice fell silent for a moment. It remained calm and showed no intent to stop her from taking the 【Forbidden】 authority, only stating a fact in an even tone.

【Mortals… cannot endure 【them】. Even if you succeed… it will mean nothing.】

【You will… die.】

“Yeah! Of course I know that! But I’m so damn sick of this! You talk like I enjoy dying! Once, twice, three times, wasn’t it always you monsters pushing people too far?!”

“Even a lump of mud has a temper! If I’m going to die today, I’ll make sure you crazy things feel it!”

As her fusion with the 【Forbidden】 continued, Sasha’s consciousness grew stronger at an alarming speed. Although her physical body was still breaking down rapidly, talking with the mysterious being was no longer as difficult as before. Instead, it became smoother and more natural.

Feeling everything that was happening, the dark and icy will fell silent again.

It did not continue speaking with Sasha, nor did it try to stop the transfer of the 【Forbidden】 authority. Perhaps it truly did not care, or perhaps it believed that even if it tried, it would be hard to compete with the girl in this area. Watching and waiting seemed the better choice.

It felt as if it was waiting for something, or as if it had already foreseen what was about to happen. What should have been a fierce struggle turned into something unbelievable. A one-sided act of taking and accepting.

And so, more and more of the power and authority contained within the 【Forbidden】 flowed into the existence and soul called “Sasha,” absorbed in a near self-destructive frenzy.

Her level of existence kept expanding. Her consciousness and her body rushed toward completely opposite endings, changing wildly, as if trying to tear her apart into unknown extremes.

Not human.

Not god.

Not life.

Not existence.

Sasha was becoming a true 【Forbidden】.

She gained power greater than ever before. Power strong enough to shake the very essence of the world itself. But because of this, she would also have to bear the absolute, unbreakable law set by the highest source.

At this moment, the girl… finally understood everything.

She would fulfill her promise to her companions. She would strip the power of the 【Forbidden】 from the black flames that had descended into the 【Forbidden Domain】. Valentia and that mysterious woman would survive because of this, but the price would be…

The existence called 【Sasha】, and all traces of her, would completely disappear from what the 【world】 is allowed to recognize.

This was… the inevitable fate of containing the 【Forbidden】.
