Chapter 276: Something Big Has Arrived!

“Wait! What did you just say? The outside world has been frozen?!”

It seemed that only now did the brown-haired girl finally realize the meaning of what had been said earlier. When she understood the possible results of all their actions, her eyes went wide, her face full of disbelief and shock.

The one who was probably most responsible, Miss Valentia, quickly turned her head away and poked her fingers together awkwardly, looking very guilty.

“H-hey, why are you looking at me like that? I didn’t expect things to turn out this bad either! And in that situation, there really wasn’t any other choice…”

“...But it’s fine! There are actually a lot of very strong people in Ice Lotus Fortress. W-with them around, it should be… probably…”

Stare—

Seeing the vampire girl look like she wasn’t even sure herself, the other two girls silently judged her with their eyes for two full seconds. For a moment, they didn’t even know what to say.

Things had reached this point because of countless accidents and coincidences piling up together.

Who should be blamed? The crown princess, who was forced to use extreme methods to deal with a huge crisis in the entire northern world? Or Valentia, who was also facing death and could only gamble everything to find a way out?

Neither answer seemed completely right. In the end, most so-called right and wrong in this world are just one-sided judgments made from different positions and personal values.

“This is unbearable… what kind of crazy mess have I been dragged into…?”

Sasha, who was the only one who seemed to have done nothing wrong, and had even risked her life earlier to drive back the terrifying black flames, rubbed her forehead helplessly. Standing on the moral high ground, she glared hard at the two troublemakers who caused nothing but worry.

The two girls, in perfect unspoken agreement, both turned their heads away, their eyes wandering. Just like a cat and a dog who had teamed up to wreck the house and were caught red-handed by their mom.

Still, no matter how worried Sasha was about her companions and the merchant group inside Ice Lotus Fortress, she could only push those worries aside for now and focus her limited energy on what was in front of her.

“Alright, alright… things are already like this. Talking more won’t help. So can someone just tell me what we’re supposed to do now?”

Miss Nolan was clearly someone with skin thicker than a city wall. Or rather, she had long since given up on pride and restraint, throwing everything she had into action. Seeing the discussion continue, the crown princess calmly raised her hand as if nothing was wrong and pointed toward the ice tower rising from the ground in the distance.

“Snow God Castle. Although the process went very differently from my original plan, in the end, we still came to it. That place is the core of everything the great god Sinong once set up. If we want to keep this land alive, the only way is to use the divine power that still remains in that holy place.”

Hearing this, Valentia nodded thoughtfully, but she could not help feeling confused.

“Your Highness Nolan, it’s not that I don’t trust you, but who told you all this? As far as I know, all records about Snow God Castle have mysteriously disappeared. Why do you know so much about it?”

“……”

Seeing the Holy Maiden frown slightly, as if she had something difficult to say, the vampire girl realized she had spoken too directly. She quickly waved her hand and changed the topic.

“Cough… so that means we have to go inside, right? If I’m not mistaken, this is probably the only way to leave the 【Forbidden Domain】 as well. So what exactly is inside that place?”

The Snow Girl turned her head to look at the vampire girl. In her ice-blue eyes, the eight-petal, ethereal snowflake mark seemed to shimmer softly. In the end, however, she only shook her head.

“I don’t know. No one knows what the great god Sinong left behind, or how to obtain it. But… the Guardian there will guide those who arrive.”

“Let’s go. There is no way back. We… must move forward.”

…………………………

“Haha… so we finally made it inside. Just stepping through the door was really not easy~”

At the foot of the mountain-like ice tower, a black-haired girl stood in the silent, eternally frozen world, smiling as she looked up at the massive structure that almost pierced the sky.

Beside her stood another tall girl with blonde hair blazing like fire. She remained silent, but her red-gold vertical pupils sharply scanned the surroundings, her eyebrows slightly raised.

“Master, this space… is very unusual. Something is moving deep within it. No, rather than something I know, it feels like a familiar ancient presence. It is… the Primordial Flame.”

“Mm…”

Violet turned to look at her dragon companion, then her gaze shifted to the little one on her shoulder. That little creature also seemed to sense something, unlike its usual lively self. It looked around cautiously, letting out soft warning sounds from time to time. Violet said nothing more, only nodded.

“All the preparation and waiting were worth it. The sealed truth may already be right in front of us.”

This place is a Divine Realm.

But at the same time, it is not entirely so.

What they found inside that enormous ice mountain, a crystal of ice that sealed what looked like half of a Fire God’s finger, was clearly some kind of anchor and medium that held a special connection.

To ordinary people, that ice crystal, formed from the Snow God’s original divine power, would be a supreme holy object. Even a tiny leak of its power could bring miracles beyond belief. But if it went out of control, it could instantly destroy everything in sight. It was an extreme double-edged sword.

Mortals could only worship it in fear, guard it carefully, and do everything they could to keep it stable.

The entire Ice Lotus Fortress existed because of it, born for it and sustained by it.

However, in the eyes of the priestess, that block of ice and those crystals of Snow God’s power were not truly the key.

They were like a treasure box made of the strongest material in the world, or rather a safe. No matter how valuable the outer shell was, it existed only to protect what was inside. Short-sighted people might be drawn to the shell itself, but true experts would focus only on the treasure contained within.

In this grand plan, Snow God Sinong stood in such a role. If Violet was not mistaken, the one who truly played the decisive part was likely the fallen god who left almost no traces behind and was barely known to anyone, the Fire God, 【Faer】.

The priestess naturally knew that Valentia and the others had already entered another space, different from the real world, through that ice crystal, the anchor. She could even faintly sense, from the outside, what those people were going through.

But… she herself could not enter.

Not only her. The Dragon God, and even a certain not-so-noticeable little wooden puppet, were the same. Their existences were simply too vast, they could not fit through that “narrow” entrance at all.

This world looks simple on the surface, but it actually merges the Divine Realms of two gods, the Snow God and the Fire God. Even Violet does not understand how they managed to do this back then. The rules here seem to instinctively reject the interference of god-level beings, so clearly, forcing one’s way in or fighting against it would be the worst possible choice.

To push three existences that have already reached god-level through such a small anchor, they had to find another path.

Sasha is that special shortcut.

The 【Forbidden Words】 are a power that feels almost all-powerful, close to “what is spoken becomes reality.” When certain conditions are met, they can even change the already-formed rules of a world.

Although Violet’s control and understanding of this power are still very rough, she cannot casually rewrite the laws of a Divine Realm from the outside. If someone could act as an extension of her will and activate a large amount of 【Forbidden】 power inside the Divine Realm, the situation would be completely different.

As for saving a certain merchant girl afterward and giving her a few “benefits,” that was only natural.

After all, Violet could hardly tell her that the sudden appearance of the Flame Calamity, and even Sasha touching the ice monument earlier and “accidentally” activating its 【Forbidden】 nature, were all influenced by someone secretly pulling the strings…

Violet may like to put people to work, but she never throws them away after using them.

Heh! She is a boss with a conscience!

And this ice tower in front of them appeared precisely because of their interference, which caused the laws of the Divine Realm to shake. Violet can clearly feel that it is the absolute core of this extremely complex space formed by the fusion of the two Divine Realms.

It is like… an emergency system that only activates at a critical moment. This is probably the final backup that the Snow God Sinong left behind after completing the plan.

While thinking this, the girl’s silver-blue eyes looked forward, resting on the base of the tower ahead.

This ice tower, more towering than any mountain, is very strange. It has no outer shell or walls. Each level looks as if it is hanging in midair. If someone stood at the edge of a high platform and looked down, a timid person would probably be scared half to death.

But if anyone thinks they can simply fly straight up to the higher levels, they would be gravely mistaken.

Even though it cannot be seen with the eyes, through the extension of her divine sense, the priestess can clearly feel the law-level power of extreme cold swirling around the entire tower like a raging storm.

It is a wall of death. Any living being that touches it directly would likely be frozen into a lifeless block of ice in an instant. The strength of this law is dozens of times greater than when the ice crystal outside fully erupted. It has reached the level of a forbidden spell, and even… faintly surpasses the realm of a supreme god.

This is an Arcane Principle.

This is not a method that Violet believes the Snow God Sinong could normally use with ease.

Perhaps it was a fleeting, all-or-nothing move left behind at the very end. Or perhaps the joint plan with the Fire God caused Sinong to lose many things, but also allowed Them, in some sense, to faintly break through that impossible, perhaps even forbidden, so-called “peak.”

Even the priestess would not casually confront divine authority of such a level head-on, because it is a power that can truly harm her.

But…

“Interesting~ This is exactly how it should be. Otherwise, it would be boring.”
