Chapter 275: The Walking Trouble Maker

Feeling the Snow Girl’s anger and worry, which clearly came from her heart, and thinking about everything she had done so far, Valentia and Sasha quietly looked at each other. Neither of them spoke, and a subtle silence fell between them.

“……”

In this world, things are never simply black or white. Even now, they still did not fully understand why this Snow Girl, who should have been noble and pure, hid her identity, gathered followers, and carried out those cruel and frightening acts before…

But it was clear that none of it was done just for fun, or out of some twisted hobby.

From the viewpoint of the victims, of course she seemed hateful and unforgivable. But if they looked at the matter from other angles, they might reach a very different conclusion.

Everything that had happened so far, and every word and action of hers, seemed to quietly send the same message. As Valentia and Sasha learned more about this mysterious Snow Girl and gradually understood her personality, their attitude toward her also began to change without them even noticing.

What to do after leaving this so-called 【Forbidden Domain】 could be decided later, once they truly escaped. For now, at least, they were still, and could only be, on the same side, bound by shared interests.

Without mentioning those sensitive topics, as if by mutual understanding, the vampire girl carefully chose her words and broke the slightly awkward silence first.

“By the way, I only understand this place on a very basic level. The ice monument doesn’t record much information. So what does it actually mean that the Snow God Castle, which should have been sleeping under the ice, has now risen to the surface?”

“Uh… y-yeah! That’s right! You’re so amazing, so explain it to us, okay?” Sasha quickly added, nodding eagerly.

“……”

The Snow Girl silently glanced at Valentia, and then at the brown-haired girl beside her, who was nodding like crazy. Her previously intense emotions were quickly pushed down again. Light flickered in her dignified, ice-blue eyes as she carefully studied the two of them for the first time, as if thinking and judging something.

But soon, the hesitation and doubt disappeared. As if she had made a decision, the girl let out a soft sigh and slowly nodded.

“You two… have probably already guessed who I am, haven’t you?”

“Huh?”

The sudden, direct question caught both of them off guard. They looked at each other, feeling a bit awkward. But since she had brought it up herself, Valentia did not hesitate or waste time. She calmly picked up the topic and nodded.

“…Alright, I won’t hide it from you. As the leader of the vampire girl delegation, and the main person responsible for this cooperation and negotiation, I carefully studied every aspect of the Snow Empire on the way here.”

“Culture, history, geography, and most importantly, the real rulers of that land. Although the Snow Empire is a mixed union of many large and small tribes, in the end, there are only two beings who truly stand at the top of power.”

She raised two fingers as she spoke, keeping it brief and clear.

“One is the Snow Emperor themself, who controls the state system and the military, and is the true ruler of the Snow Empire. The other is the head of the Eternal Winter Temple, the Holy Maiden Nolan Sinong, who represents divine power and faith.”

“Whether negotiations and alliances succeed ultimately depends on the attitudes of these two. Especially the Crown Princess, who is said to have just fallen on the northern battlefield. That incident itself is full of strange points and doubts. Because of that, I tried every way possible to gather information about her, hoping to find any weaknesses or hidden truths.”

“And among that information, naturally included the most important thing—”

Feeling that words alone were not clear enough, Valentia simply took out a small notebook from her clothes and flipped to a certain page. What appeared before them was a half-body portrait, drawn with charcoal. It looked simple and rough, but the figure in the sketch was immediately recognizable.

The woman in the drawing also had long hair hanging down freely. Behind her were six long, flowing ribbons that were very easy to recognize. The artist’s skill was not very good, honestly it even looked a bit like a child’s drawing, but you could still roughly make out the shape of her face and body.

Well… compared to the Snow Girl standing in front of them, she looked about thirty percent similar?

“Cough… um, well, you get what I mean! Long hair, right? Hahaha…”

Seeing the Snow Girl staring hard at the doodle labeled “Nolan Sinong”, with several dark lines clearly forming on her forehead, Valentia realized something was wrong. She quickly gave an awkward laugh, snapped the notebook shut, on the lower right corner was a small mark that looked like a little fox, and hid it back in her clothes at lightning speed.

“What good stuff is that…? Hey, I haven’t seen it yet! Let me take a look too!”

Ignoring the merchant girl who tried to squeeze in out of curiosity, the slightly guilty vampire girl girl coughed several times in a row and forced the topic to change.

“A-anyway! Right now, there are only a few known Pure Snow Girls in the entire northern world. Most of them, or rather none of them, could possibly appear here at a time like this. But… if we consider some possibilities that are still just theories…”

“There is one person who fits perfectly!”

“You know, when you feel guilty, you don’t have to keep touching your nose…”

It seemed that the unknown portrait had made her blood pressure rise. The Snow Girl was clearly at a loss for words. Still, as someone who had seen many great events, she quickly recovered after a brief moment of awkwardness. She let out a soft sigh and nodded calmly.

“You guessed correctly. I am Nolan Sinong.”

“W-wow…”

Even though Sasha had already vaguely guessed it, hearing the confirmation directly still felt unreal. She could not help letting out a sound of surprise. Valentia stayed more calm, but her face also showed clear shock.

“So… Your Highness Nolan, did you really fake your own death on purpose?”

“Why go that far? Just to act in secret like this? Even if Ice Lotus Fortress really has serious problems, with your status and position in the Snow Empire, there should have been easier and faster ways to deal with it. How could you do something so—”

“You want to say I’m too extreme… right?”

Looking at the vampire girl girl’s face, full of shock, confusion, and words she couldn’t quite say, the Snow Girl, or rather, the current Crown Princess of the Snow Empire, the Holy Maiden Nolan Sinong, shook her head with a slightly self-mocking smile.

“Little vampire girl girl, the Eternal Winter Temple, and the environment and interests of the snowlands, are far more complicated than you imagine. The Holy Maiden may seem high and mighty, but she still faces countless limits and helpless choices.”

“I have tried almost every method. I even lowered myself and begged outside gods for help. But the result… heh. If I weren’t truly at the edge of despair, who would be willing to use such methods?”

“Rather than slowly walk toward destruction in silence, I would rather risk everything and fight once, no matter the cost.”

“Your Highness Nolan…”

“Don’t look at me like that. To be honest, this time I was already planning to cooperate with them. No matter what, I had to enter the 【Forbidden Domain】 through this special point called Ice Lotus Fortress and obtain certain things here. I just didn’t expect…”

At this point, Nolan suddenly gave Valentia a strange look.

“Originally, the ritual would have required burning several thousand souls as sacrifice. The damage would still have been barely within a controllable range. But I didn’t expect you to be so bold, and so capable. When pushed into a corner, you actually activated the passage between the 【Forbidden Domain】 and the real world all by yourself.”

“And now look at the result. The 【Forbidden Domain】 is open, but the Snow God’s power has also burst out of control. By now, the entire Ice Lotus Fortress, at least several hundred thousand living beings inside, has probably been completely frozen.”

“From this point of view, your methods are far more extreme than mine…”

“Uh…”
