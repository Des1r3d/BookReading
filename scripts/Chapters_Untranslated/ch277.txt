Chapter 277: Oh~ Children Who Have Come from Afar!

The Dragon God clearly also noticed the storm of laws swirling around the ice tower. But her way of doing things was always simpler and more straightforward than Violet’s. She just raised her head, glanced at the invisible barrier that looked like an absolute death zone, and spoke briefly.

“Master, should we just rush straight in?”

“Oh?”

The priestess was a little intrigued by this question.

To be honest, ever since Xiao Guang awakened the Primordial Flame and became the Dragon God, even she was no longer sure how far the limits of this dragon, whom she had personally raised since childhood, could really go.

Especially after learning about the hidden truth, and indirectly coming into contact with two great beings closely tied to the dragon girl’s origin, the 【Blazing Phoenix God】 and the 【Dragon Emperor】. This sense of mystery and the unknown had reached its peak.

If Primordial Flame truly came from what the 【Blazing Phoenix God】 left behind in the previous era, and had adapted to the rules of the current era, turning into a form that was easier to use and control, then combined with the status that the 【Dragon Emperor】 possessed, the power it could release would probably be no less than that so-called “Lords of the World” or “Primordials”.

That meant Xiao Guang might very well have already broken through the absolute limit of level 100, or even done so long ago. It was just that as they continued to change and grow, the game-style combat system from Illusory World, those panel stats, could no longer accurately measure her or Violet’s true strength.

Even on the simple pet status panel, Xiao Guang was still shown as level 100. But after gaining the “Divinity” that came with Primordial Flame, which lay outside the system’s judgment range, the Dragon God’s real strength was completely a mystery, one that could only be tested in real combat.

There was no need to beat around the bush with her own partner. Understanding each other perfectly, Violet also went straight to the point.

“Will you get hurt?”

After glancing again at the invisible divine power outside the ice tower, the Dragon God curled her lips, looking a little dismissive.

“If this power appeared as an attack, or a sudden ambush, it might indeed be troublesome if I wasn’t ready. But right now it’s just standing there stiffly like this. If I still can’t deal with it after proper preparation, then Master would really be underestimating me, wouldn’t she?”

“That’s true…”

The priestess nodded slightly, as if she understood something. She smiled, but did not continue the topic, and instead stepped forward.

“Let’s go.”

“Oh… eh? Master, are you really just going to walk up slowly like this?”

“What else should we do? Tear down their tower the moment we arrive? Come on, we’re civilized people. Be polite. Can you stop thinking about violence all the time~?”

“I thought you enjoyed things that were more intense…”

“Hey, hey, what are you implying?!”

…………………………

Although the entire ice tower was surrounded by a terrifying, invisible power of laws, at least the very bottom, the first level, did not have that kind of thing.

The lowest platform was also the largest area. It looked like an extremely wide ice plaza. The two girls met almost no resistance and easily stepped into its range.

But there was truly nothing here. Even the stairs or paths that should have led to higher levels were nowhere to be seen. The upper platforms floated in midair more than ten meters above the ground, with no supports at all. The overly empty space made it hard to tell what was going on.

“It doesn’t seem that special. By the way, couldn’t Sinong have added a bit more decoration when building this place? It’s supposed to be a divine temple or holy land or something. This looks way too bare and shabby…”

In the completely empty and unusually quiet space, the black-haired girl looked around with curiosity. At the same time, she muttered complaints about some strange things. It was very clear that she felt no real respect at all toward the god she was talking about.

Perhaps this disrespect broke some kind of rule, or maybe it was just a coincidence. The moment the priestess finished speaking, the surroundings suddenly changed!

It was as if they had stepped into a completely different world. Curtains seemed to fall from all sides of the ice tower, blocking out the outside view that had been clearly visible before. Dreamlike, holy light shimmered and spread, filling almost the entire space in a way that could be seen with the naked eye. It looked just like a sacred ice temple where a god had descended.

“Oh~ chosen children who have come from afar, welcome, welcome to Snow God Castle~!”

A loud, holy, yet clear and pleasant voice echoed through the vast ice hall along with this sudden change.

“Tch, stop pretending to be mysterious. Let me—”

“Hey, calm down!”

Sensing something unusual from the aura, the Dragon God frowned and was about to raise her hand to act. Fortunately, Violet, who looked full of interest, noticed her intention in time and quietly tugged at her dragon’s clothes. This prevented some… not-so-peaceful events from happening too early.

Seemingly unaware of these small actions between the two girls, the mysterious, airy female voice that had appeared nearby, without any clear source, continued her performance.

“I know why you have come. A thousand years of sealing has reached its end. The divine holy land, buried by time, is about to return to the world. All of this was within the expectations of the Great Ice and Snow God, Lord Sinong. However, if you wish to become leaders of this era and inherit the divine relics that can save the world, you must still pass the trials.”

“Oh, so… who are you, then?”

After listening to this long speech, and finally finding a pause, the priestess, who had been itching to speak, quickly jumped in.

The mysterious voice seemed to hear her clearly and replied without hesitation.

“An excellent question. By the order of the great god Sinong, I am one of the remnant race left behind to guard Snow God Castle and wait for future visitors. You may call me a 【Guardian】.”

“Children who carry ideals and faith, next, the 【Guardian】 will guide you onto the path of trials. Snow God Castle has a total of ninety-nine floors. On each floor, there is a different test left behind by the gods.”

“Show your courage, wisdom, determination, and strength. Overcome them, reach the ice temple at the highest floor, and only then will you be qualified to inherit the will of the great god Sinong and save all life in this world!”

“Why does this sound kind of familiar…?”

Hearing how the other side, without much probing or even properly checking their identities, casually revealed almost all the important information in one long speech, the two girls exchanged looks and reached a silent agreement.

This so-called 【Guardian】 didn’t seem very smart.

Following the principle of… well, “no reason not to take advantage,” and since the other side loved talking so much, Violet naturally would not miss this perfect chance to gather more information. She quickly spoke again.

“Wait, you just mentioned a remnant race. So are there many 【Guardians】 like you inside this ice tower?”

“W-what? Of course not! Let me tell you, cough! Ch-children seeking salvation, if you wish to learn more secrets about the 【Guardians】, then move forward bravely and break through the trials! As long as you reach the highest floor of Snow God Castle, you will obtain everything you desire!”

“…Did this person almost let something slip just now?”

The priestess and her dragon continued to whisper and exchange looks, but they were not in a hurry to expose the other side’s fake mystery. After all, no amount of talking was better than experiencing it directly through action.

“Alright, alright, trials, trials. I’m very familiar with this kind of thing… hurry up and bring it on!”
