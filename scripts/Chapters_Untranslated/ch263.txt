Chapter 263: The Blooming Light

In fact, the world outside the frost barrier had already become a place of absolute death.

Wherever the 【Frostflow】 passed, everything was turned into deep, dark blue ice under 【Extreme Cold】. The original structure of the tunnel collapsed as bricks and stone shattered, the whole place shaking violently. Then, piece by piece, it froze solid, finally becoming a land of ultimate ice, locked in a single frozen moment.

That was clearly the true source of the earlier thunder-like shaking. Power that was almost absolute, the force of extreme cold itself!

“No… I can’t hold on…!”

A 【Seal Wielder】 turned pale. Fine cracks had appeared on the seal in his hand. This was not because he had pushed its power beyond its limit. Instead, the 【Extreme Cold】 from outside was spreading inward along invisible paths of magic, freezing everything connected to it.

As the High Priestess and the leader of the combined defense, Kellian naturally bore more pressure than anyone else.

At this moment, her body, her hair and even her eyebrows, was already covered in a thin layer of white frost formed by the cold. The six ribbon-like extensions that supported the barrier had been frozen solid by the extreme cold, turning into hard blocks of ice.

Even so, even though she understood better than anyone that they could never stop the incoming 【Frostflow】, the High Priestess still gave everything she had. She burned everything she could, stubbornly holding up the barrier as it fell apart before her eyes.

It was not only because they had no way to retreat, the result of being swallowed by the 【Frostflow】 was painfully clear. It was also because Kellian clearly understood the true nature of this inhuman power. She knew that if it broke out of the tunnel and destroyed the main fortress of Ice Lotus Keep outside, the result would be unimaginable.

It would be worse than the 【Northern Calamity】. A true disaster that could overturn the entire northern nations itself.

A Divine Calamity!!!

“Ice and snow… Great God… please calm… your anger…”

The High Priestess whispered in a trembling voice. Her body was slowly turning into true ice crystal, starting from the divine seal that had been mercilessly frozen, spreading outward in all directions.

Three seconds, only three seconds.

The once brilliantly shining seal had turned into an ice sculpture floating in midair. Only because Kellian was squeezing every last drop of magic from herself and all the 【Seal Wielders】 was it barely able to keep functioning at the most basic level.

But even after reaching the very limits of what they could do, in front of the vast, surging 【Frostflow】, all human effort looked small and helpless.

And so, under the nearly hopeless gaze of everyone present, the ice-blue fortress that protected their last hope quietly “melted” in the howling wind.

It did not shatter. It did not collapse.

From the countless spreading cracks, a deeper, darker frost-blue color began to spread in all directions. At a speed that looked slow but was actually terrifyingly fast, it replaced the original barrier.

The frozen ice was absorbed and turned into the same substance as the invader, the deepest extreme cold in the world.

Then—

It rushed toward the now completely unprotected people!

“BOOM!!!!!!!”

The terrifying 【Frostflow】 surged like a massive wave. In almost an instant, it covered everyone standing in its path.

There was no mercy. No struggle. No screams.

Where 【Extreme Cold】 passed, its deep essence and absolute law descended, covering everything and freezing it into a hollow, silent moment.

Whether it was the executors on the outer edge, using their bodies to protect their companions, or the 【Seal Wielders】 already covered head to toe in frost, every single figure, all over a hundred of the Eternal Winter Temple’s most elite warriors, was turned in an instant into lifelike ice statues, frozen in their final poses and movements.

“Bang!!!”

Only at the moment just before being swallowed by the freezing tide did Kellian, the High Priestess, experience something different. The plain necklace on her chest, made of an unknown material, suddenly burst with dazzling light, like a shield, blocking the 【Frostflow】 one more time for her.

The powerful impact threw the High Priestess away like a cannon shot. She almost turned into a blur as she was slammed hard into the tunnel wall dozens of meters away!

“Cough!!”

Kellian spat out a mouthful of blood. What was truly frightening was that even the blood she coughed up was mixed with a large amount of frost-blue ice fragments, already frozen solid, hitting the ground with sharp cracking sounds.

Leaning against the wall, the High Priestess struggled to raise her head. In front of her, all the familiar figures had turned into ice statues. The divine seal in her hand had long lost all light and power, rolling to the ground nearby like a lump of ice. The terrifying 【Frostflow】 rushing toward her dyed her entire view in an endless, deadly deep blue.

She breathed with great difficulty, unable to care about the burning, bone-breaking pain in her back or her body, which was already more than half frozen. Her eyes stayed wide open, staring at the raging 【Frostflow】 that looked as if it would swallow her again in the next moment.

The biting cold was spreading to every corner of her body, freezing her blood and solidifying her soul. Her once sharp and quick thoughts had become slow and dull. Yet, perhaps because she was facing death, some of her thoughts became unusually clear and sharp.

Is this… the end?

For herself… and for the entire Ice Lotus Fortress…

She had guessed many times about who those mysterious invaders were and what their goals might be, but she had never imagined they would dare, or even be able, to do something this insane.

Why? Why exactly?

How could they break that seal?!

That was something even Holy Maiden 【Snowfall】, and even the first founder of the Eternal Winter Temple, the true Eternal Winter Holy Maiden, had been unable to do!

When Ice Lotus Fortress was first built, all sides involved, the royal family, the Temple, even the Holy Maiden, had argued countless times. But all they discussed was how to deal with that power. Whether to seal it, or to use a small amount of frost that leaked through the cracks between gods for their own benefit. No one had ever dared to desire the deep essence of 【Extreme Cold】 itself!

That was a power no mortal could ever control. The moment they opened that seal, the first ones to be destroyed would be themselves!

She could not understand it. Kellian could not understand at all how things had reached this point. Even if the Northern Calamity had truly destroyed the Snow Empire and reached this frozen land of the past, it would not dare, nor be able, to do something so terrifying.

But no matter how much shock, anger, or confusion filled her heart, it could not change the ending she now faced.

Staring at the howling anger and punishment from a god, the High Priestess accepted her fate and slowly closed her eyes.

In the end… it was still greed that caused this disaster.

Perhaps long ago, when the first so-called Ice Lotus was born from wind and frost, they should have sealed this place completely, no matter the cost, instead of holding onto false hope and trying to use, to draw from, that seemingly beautiful “gift.”

Everything was already too late.

…Hm?

Just as Kellian’s heart finally went completely cold and she prepared to quietly face the coming destruction, something unexpected appeared at the edge of her darkening vision. Something that should never have appeared in a place like this.

Startled, she opened her eyes again without thinking.

“?”

This time, she saw it clearly.

There were two figures, two young girls who had appeared here at some unknown moment.

They were standing just behind a corner not far away. That spot had been a blind angle, outside the Temple team’s line of sight. It seemed that only because the High Priestess had been thrown far back by the impact did she happen to land near this area and see them.

This unexpected situation also seemed to catch the two girls off guard. As Kellian looked at them in shock, the black-haired girl in white robes blinked at her and showed a smile that looked unsure, somewhere between awkward and helpless.

But very quickly, she turned her head back to the front. Together with the blonde girl beside her, she faced the god-like 【Extreme Cold】 that was descending like divine punishment.

Perhaps because of her severe injuries, or because of the deep frost-blue light filling everything, their figures in the High Priestess’s eyes… suddenly became a little blurry.

Realizing what they were about to do, Kellian felt a wave of panic. She did not even have time to care that they might have been secretly following them, and tried to warn them at once.

“No! Run—cough!!”

But her body had already reached its limit under the erosion of extreme cold. The moment she opened her mouth, she spat out another large mouthful of blood mixed with terrifying ice shards. As her fading life reached its final moment of clarity, the world before her eyes finally began to sink into darkness, losing its light and color.

Yes… run.

But where could they run to?

It was already… over.

“BOOM!!!!!!!!”

The extreme cold arrived.

And then, she heard it. A soft voice echoing quietly through the wind and frost, like a divine command.

“I say, let there be light.”

The world, stained by darkness, shone once more.

That light poured into Kellian’s dim, ice-blue eyes and lit up the entire frozen underground tunnel, like a light of salvation descending from the very end of despair—

It bloomed!!!

“Vmmm—!!!!”

That scene, one she would likely never forget for the rest of her life, reflected in her shocked gaze and was carved deep into her soul.

That was… true salvation.

The black-haired girl in white stood alone within the endless light. She simply stretched out one hand and pushed it forward. From her palm, vast and mighty light spread out.

The radiance then formed a barrier, far stronger and far more holy than the shield the Temple had created with all their strength before, beautiful and clear, like pure crystal. It stood directly in the path of the 【Frostflow】 of 【Extreme Cold】.

“BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!!!!!!”

Like an unbreakable dam meant to save the world, the terrifying 【Frostflow】, carrying endless extreme cold, crashed into the wall of light, releasing a thunderous roar as if the heavens and earth were breaking apart.

Three seconds…

Five seconds…

Ten seconds…!

It could not move forward even a single step!

It— it was blocked!?

With just one hand, without using any weapon or tool at all, she had blocked something that no mortal body should ever be able to stop…

A Divine Calamity!?
