Chapter 266: Fire and Heresy

“Hey, hey, what are you even talking about… Who would understand that? Can you explain it in a way normal people can understand?”

Seeing the brown-haired girl’s helpless expression, Valentia sighed and shook her head. She raised her hand and pointed to a spot nearby.

“Look over there.”

“Huh… so mysterious. I have to say, you really sound like one of those annoying riddle people…”

She kept complaining, but Sasha’s body was very honest. She turned her head and looked in the direction the vampire girl pointed to.

Only then did she notice a simple, ancient ice monument, about the height of a person, standing upright like a warning sign next to the strange patch of land that had not been frozen.

The two girls walked closer. The merchant girl stared at the surface of the stone with curiosity. Just as she expected, it was covered with a lot of writing left by someone long ago. But it was neither the common language of the snow regions nor any familiar southern language. She immediately looked troubled.

“Uh… so what is this?”

“It’s 【Ancient Niel language】,” Valentia explained kindly. “A common written language used in the Age of Gods, shared by the gods and their followers. It’s also called 【Ancient Divine language】.”

She shook her head slightly as she continued.

“This language carries special power and status. Writing or carving it requires very strict conditions. It was once a symbol of divine authority and supreme rule. But when the age of myths ended and the gods slowly disappeared, the main users of 【Ancient Niel language】 vanished as well, and the language faded into history.”

“So it’s normal that you can’t read it, Sasha. As long as—”

She seemed about to do something and reached out her hand toward the brown-haired girl, but—

For some unknown reason, Sasha had already raised her hand, as if drawn by something. She placed her palm directly on the ancient ice monument.

“D-don’t touch it randomly!”

“Huh?”

“ZZzz—!”

In front of the two girls’ equally shocked faces, the strange symbols on the ice monument suddenly lit up.

Like a screen being powered on, the entire monument began to glow with soft, clear light. Even though Sasha was startled and quickly pulled back her hand, the light did not fade. Instead, it grew brighter and brighter, rising and gathering upward.

“W-w-what?!”

Clearly, Valentia had not expected this at all. Her carefully kept air of mystery collapsed instantly. She stared wide-eyed at the glowing monument, then hurriedly turned to Sasha.

“Wait! What did you do just now?!”

“E-even if you ask me that… how would I know?! I just lightly touched it, okay?!”

“You’d better hope you only touched it lightly!!!”

The two girls panicked and blamed each other, but nothing they did could stop the change from continuing. As the light grew stronger, something even more unbelievable began to happen.

The square monument, originally made of extreme ice, slowly burst into deep red flames. The fire leaped wildly, and together with the carved letters, the entire monument turned into roaring fire.

Under the burning flames, the ice melted at a speed visible to the naked eye. Yet the original stone pillar did not collapse or disappear. Instead, it was like shedding its outer shell, turning into a blazing monument made of pure red fire. It kept almost the same shape as before, but felt completely different, hot and powerful.

As this change happened, the frozen ground beneath the pillar also began to melt slowly under the heat. It revealed the same deep black soil as the land nearby where the ice lotuses grew.

“Uh-oh…”

Seeing this, Valentia’s expression changed slightly. She was just about to act, but an invisible, overwhelming force of extreme cold, like a law of the world itself, gathered faster than she could react.

“Zzzzzz…!”

It was like burning fire being hit by a wave of cold water. Even though nothing seemed to change in the visible scene, the edges of the melting ice suddenly made a sharp, explosive sound.

Right after that, the melting slowed down quickly and was soon completely stopped.

In the end, the affected area only spread to a small circle centered on the pillar, just over one meter across. It looked scary, but compared to the earlier exposed land of more than a hundred square meters, it did not seem like a very big problem.

Uh… probably?

“So… um… did we mess something up?”

“…I need to correct that. This was done by you, Miss Sasha. Please don’t include me,” Valentia replied flatly.

“Hey, that’s not fair! We’re clearly in this together!”

The two girls, not really understanding what was going on, looked at each other and argued a little. Then they instinctively turned their attention back to the strange pillar, now made of burning red flames.

In fact, even after such a huge and confusing change, the text on the pillar had not disappeared. However, after turning into fire, the shapes and symbols of the carved words changed in a completely unbelievable way.

Yes, it had turned into a completely different script, and an entirely different message.

And this time, it was Valentia who could not read it.

The vampire girl frowned deeply, staring at the dense lines of text drawn in pure flame on the fire pillar. Her confusion was obvious.

“So what exactly is going on here…?”

“Um… well…”

Sasha weakly raised her hand and spoke carefully.

“I mean… I think I can actually understand what this says.”

“Huh?”

Valentia froze for a moment. But remembering that it was Sasha’s touch that had caused all these changes, she could only nod helplessly, no matter how unbelievable it felt.

“All right then. Miss Sasha, could you help translate what’s written here?”

“…Wait, now that you mention it, you never told me what the earlier text said either…”

Sasha complained a little, since the situation had clearly reversed. But she was not the type to hold grudges. Though a bit speechless, she still followed Valentia’s request and carefully studied the blazing fire pillar again. After thinking for a moment, she spoke.

“Uh, roughly speaking, the meaning should be—”

Just as the brown-haired girl was about to explain the message in simple words, a sudden, loud shout exploded from not far away!

“Shut up!!!”

“Wah!!”

The sudden shout scared Sasha badly. The words she was about to say were forced back down her throat.

She clearly did not expect that, in a place like this, there would be a third person besides the two of them. Forgetting about being angry, she quickly turned toward the source of the voice.

Sure enough, from behind an ice wall not far away, a figure stepped out of the darkness and began walking toward them.

It was a woman wrapped head to toe in a dark cloak. Her features and face were hard to see, yet in this frozen, silent world, she stood out strongly.

Because of the hood, most of her face was hidden in shadow. Only a small part could be seen. Even so, the cold, commanding presence she gave off was unforgettable at first glance, like someone born to stand above others, firm and unquestionable.

“Wait… you are…?”

Sasha had seen this face and this outfit before.

Even though it was only a brief glimpse, she clearly remembered it. Before entering this frozen world, when the magic circle on the wall was activated by Valentia, there had been a terrifying intruder. That person had burst into the underground room, trying to stop her.

There was no doubt, it was this same cold-looking woman in the cloak.

Remembering the frightening power and pressure the woman showed back then, Sasha felt her heart tremble. She took two steps back without thinking, but ended up bumping into the soft body of the girl beside her. Ignoring embarrassment or warmth, she hurriedly warned her.

“Va–Valentia! Run! This person…!”

Compared to Sasha’s panic, the vampire girl was clearly much calmer. She frowned slightly, but did not look afraid. Instead, she raised a hand to steady Sasha’s shoulder and spoke gently to comfort her.

“It’s all right, Miss Sasha. This place is a land ruled by divine power. Under its laws, no living being here can use their own strength. Everyone is no different from an ordinary person. So we are completely safe.”

“…Huh? There’s a rule like that?”

Sasha froze for a moment. With so many strange things happening one after another, she had not noticed until Valentia said it. Now that she paid attention, she realized her body did feel heavier in this frozen world, as if invisible chains were holding her back. Her movements felt slower and less smooth.

Even she, a trained fighter, was clearly affected. That meant people who depended more on magic and the energy in the air, like mages with weaker bodies, would be restricted even more.

But—

“Uh…”

Seeing the slight change in Sasha’s expression, Valentia thought she was just uncomfortable with the loss of strength and quickly added more reassurance.

“It’s okay. According to the words on the pillar, this rule only works inside this world. It won’t cause permanent harm. Once we leave, the effect will disappear on its own.”

“Ah? Oh… o-oh…”

Sasha mumbled a few unclear sounds and forced out an awkward smile. She felt a faint warmth coming from a church holy book in her arms, one with a very questionable origin. Out of the corner of her eye, she glanced at the third person, who was already very close, and in the end…

She still did not say it out loud, that she seemed to still be able to use those “god-given spells”, and that the suppression from the rules did not seem strong enough to turn her into a completely “normal person.”

It was not that Sasha distrusted Valentia or was being cautious of her. It was just that, no matter why she showed these special abilities, having one more hidden card in a situation like this could never be a bad thing. After all, who knew whether that terrifying person walking toward them could do the same?

The two girls had only whispered to each other for a short while when the mysterious cloaked woman had already reached them.

Those ice-blue eyes, half hidden under the hood, looked the two girls up and down as if judging them. Valentia showed no fear at all. Like a hen protecting her chick, she stepped in front of the slightly scared Sasha, refusing to back down. She stared fiercely at the woman, hands on her hips, full of open challenge.

From Valentia’s calm reaction, it was clear she already knew that this person had also entered this world with them. They just had not met until now.

“What are you staring at? Got a problem? Come on then! We’re not afraid of you here! Hit me if you dare, idiot!”

Throwing away her usual elegant manners toward friends and social circles, Valentia acted like a small cat showing its claws. She mocked the mysterious woman without holding back, yet did not move forward or attack. Her strategy was simple, verbal attacks only.

Hmm… those words, annoying but oddly cute, really felt like they came straight from someone’s influence.

Valentia thought the woman would focus her anger on her, since she was the one who activated the hidden magic circle on the wall and ruined her plan. But after jumping around and mocking her for a while, she noticed something strange.

The woman’s gaze… was mostly fixed on the other girl beside her. She barely looked at Valentia at all?!

Huh? What was going on?

“Hey, you—”

“Speak! Who exactly are you, and why do you have this forbidden power? Was all of this part of your plan?!”

Three sharp questions came out in a row, filled with cold authority that left no room for doubt. The cloaked woman’s deep voice stunned both girls. After a brief, strange silence, the merchant girl, who was being stared at so coldly that her skin crawled, hesitantly raised a finger and pointed at herself.

“Y-you… are you talking to me?”

“Of course! Besides us, is there anyone else alive here?!”

“Uh… is it possible that I’m also al—”

Feeling ignored, the vampire girl weakly raised her hand, but before she could finish speaking, the mysterious woman suddenly shouted “Ah!” and pulled out a beautiful longsword that looked like it was made of ice. Its sharp tip pointed straight at the two girls!

Well… to be exact, it was aimed at the brown-haired girl who looked completely confused.

“Speak honestly! Who ordered you to hide your identity and sneak into the forbidden area to do all this?! Don’t force me! Otherwise, even if we die together today, I will destroy you completely!”

“Gulp…”

Hearing that this was clearly no joke, Sasha, who had somehow become the target, swallowed hard and spoke carefully.

“Uh, um… miss, could there be a misunderstanding? I really don’t have any powerful backer. I’m just a normal person who got dragged into this. Are you sure you’re not looking for this one instead?”

She pointed at the vampire girl beside her, who clearly looked more like the real troublemaker. The vampire girl quickly nodded hard, shouting, “Yes, yes, that’s right!” to make herself noticed.

But the mysterious woman… seemed to grow even angrier.

“Bastard! Are you insulting my intelligence?! You triggered and even tried to read the 【Forbidden Words】, yet suffered no backlash at all! And you call that a ‘normal person’?!”
