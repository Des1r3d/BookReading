Chapter 255: Why Do Children Turn Bad?

She had only brought up that topic to lighten the strange mood, but when the vampire girl replied in such a direct way, the brown-haired girl became visibly more awkward.

Her eyes had nowhere to look. A faint blush rose on her healthy, wheat-colored cheeks, and she quickly turned her head away, muttering things that even she herself did not really understand.

“Um… Valentia, you’re not actually hungry, are you…? I mean, for you vampires, drinking blood is probably normal, but don’t think you can just say that and I’ll agree, okay? B-biting the neck and stuff sounds really painful… haha…”

Seeing that the usually energetic girl was now talking nonsense and acting like a shy young lady, the vampire girl, who had noticed this cute contrast, could not hide the growing smile on her face.

“That’s a misunderstanding,” she said with a laugh. “Vampires are a civilized race that values manners. Normally, we only drink blood by direct skin contact when the other person is an extremely close partner from another race. Of course, if Miss Sasha is willing, we could slowly develop our relationship in the future and get to know each other better.”

“And by the way, it doesn’t actually hurt at all~”

“Eh… is that so? No, wait! Who said I want to be bitten so easily?! Hold on, that’s not even the point! The ‘relationship’ you’re talking about, does that really sound proper to you?!”

“Hehe~ Miss Sasha, you’re really interesting~”

After this light and well-timed chat, the distance between the two girls, caused by their unfamiliarity, quickly shrank. The tension of being in danger also eased a lot. Valentia covered her mouth and laughed softly, but she was careful not to embarrass Sasha too much, and naturally let the topic pass.

“Alright, just joking~ No one can clearly say what the future will be like anyway. For now, let’s focus on the problem in front of us. After all, only if we survive can we think about the future, right?”

Seeing the pure and beautiful face of the vampire girl turn serious again, Sasha, who had been struggling to keep up with the playful teasing, finally let out a quiet sigh of relief and also became more serious.

“So, what do you plan to do? Bet everything on possible reinforcements coming, or forget all worries and try to find a way out by ourselves?”

“……”

When the talk turned serious, Valentia clearly became much more focused. She silently looked at Sasha, her blood-red vertical pupils sweeping across the room, and finally stopping on the heavy metal door, the only connection to the outside.

Deep in her eyes, a faint golden-red light flickered, as if her gaze quietly crossed countless barriers and met another pair of eyes far away.

After a short pause, she spoke softly again, almost as if talking to herself.

“It really is hard to choose. No matter which option we take, there are risks. It seems there is no truly ‘right’ answer.”

“Then…”

“However—”

Suddenly, the girl changed her tone and cut off Sasha, who was about to speak.

“A friend once taught me an idea that’s very worth considering. She said that what people call a ‘choice’ is, in essence, just a ‘compromise’ forced on the weak when they have no option but to give something up.”

“Instead of struggling over which choice is correct, it may be better to step outside the logic forced on us, refuse to compromise, and break the usual rules and limits. That way, we might get an unexpected result.”

“Uh… that friend of yours, never mind… So, what are you actually trying to say?”

The vampire girl suddenly turned her head. Seeing the brown-haired girl in front of her looking completely confused, with question marks almost floating over her head, a bright light suddenly burst out from her blood-red eyes!

That was excitement, hidden beneath her elegant manners and gentle appearance, the true nature of Valentia Constantius.

“Only children choose between options! I want everything!!!”

…………………………

“?”

Walking through the wide but slightly dark corridors of the castle, a black-haired girl suddenly tilted her head and glanced in a certain direction under her feet, her expression a bit strange.

“What’s wrong, Master?”

“Oh, nothing. I just feel like someone is talking about me… how should I say it… my nose feels kind of itchy?”

“Tch… must be some sneaky cat fooling around again.”

“Hey, I heard that, you know! Don’t be so rude! And good kids shouldn’t keep clicking their tongues like that!”

“Please rest assured, Master. I won’t do anything that puts you in a difficult position.”

“You saying that actually makes it even harder to feel reassured!”

The two girls chatted casually like this, their footsteps never stopping. Compared to their light, meaningless talk, with a bit of warmth mixed in, the scene in front of them was a completely different world.

Blood. Corpses. Frost.

From the moment they entered the main castle, a hellish scene of cruelty was laid bare before their eyes.

In fact, the castle had long been covered by some invisible barrier. No matter what happened inside, unless the whole castle was blown into the sky at once, the outer city guards and defense forces probably would not notice anything.

Because of that, compared to the silent killing of the guards at the gate, the slaughter inside the castle was clearly more direct and efficient.

Bodies of elite guards and castle servants lay everywhere. Some had their throats cut with precise strikes. Others had their heads completely chopped off, rolling on the ground after separating from their bodies, leaving headless corpses spraying blood.

Blood gathered into small streams and soaked into the red carpets, making their already bright color look even darker.

Even so, this was actually not the most common way the castle guards had died.

After all, the snowy lands were famous for mining, metalworking, and forging. As the strongest guard force under the lord of the castle, the Ice Lotus Castle guards were fully armored, every one of them. Even their heads and necks, the most fragile parts, were tightly protected by metal. Combined with their carefully selected combat skills, cutting through armor and skull by brute force was not something an ordinary fighter could do.

So, unlike most of the servants in the castle, those powerful soldiers sealed inside metal armor, almost like steel cans, were frozen to death.

“Crack~”

With a light kick of her small leather shoe, Violet sent a palm-sized chunk of ice that was blocking her path rolling away. It hit a nearby pillar and shattered on the spot into more than ten smaller pieces.

The priestess casually glanced at it. She could clearly see that inside this piece of ice, and inside countless other ice fragments scattered along the hallway, were bodies broken apart as if dismembered.

They were the bodies of elite guards.

Armor wrapped around frozen flesh. Under that extreme cold, even heavy armor that could block blades and axes had become as fragile as glass. With just a small impact, it would shatter together with the ice.

Among the castle guards, only about one or two out of ten had truly died in close combat. Most of those had been killed by poison needles stabbed through gaps in their armor.

The rest… were all part of this field of frost.
